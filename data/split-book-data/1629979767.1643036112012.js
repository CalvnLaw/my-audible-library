window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You talk to yourself all day long. We all do. Most of what we say carries no emotional weight, but sometimes, what we tell ourselves affects the very quality of our lives: “Of course I didn’t get that job. My father was right; no one’s going to hire me at my age.” In the 24 compelling half-hour lectures of <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Daily Life</i>, Professor Jason Satterfield will help you build your cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) toolbox, giving you the skills you need to change those stories that hold you back and that keep you from experiencing your fullest life possible. In using these tools appropriately, you will be building a life that is both more powerful and more peaceful than you had ever imagined.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CBT approach helps us because it’s almost never just the situation that directly affects our emotional health - it’s our thoughts about the situation. No matter what difficulties we face in life, it’s how we address those challenges that makes the difference.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Daily Life</i>, you’ll have the opportunity to be the proverbial fly on the wall of the therapist’s office. As you see actors portraying clients, you see Dr. Satterfield discussing his thoughts about the six clients - explaining what he learns from what they do say and do not say, their body language, their willingness to take on and accomplish homework assignments, and more. He also explains which specific CBT tool(s) he chooses for each of them and why. Since several of these clients are shown in multiple sessions over time, you’ll see firsthand how they benefit from the implementation of CBT in their lives. And as you follow them, you’ll be developing the CBT tools you can use to help yourself and maybe those you love. These tools and skills will not only help you address problems, but will also help you learn to create and savor positive experiences that bring greater happiness, satisfaction, and meaning to your life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Disclaimer: Please note that this recording may include references to supplemental texts or print references that are not essential to the program and not supplied with your purchase.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
