window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seven centuries into the future, aliens and humans compete for the greatest prize in the universe: the Galaxy Bowl trophy. Quarterback Quentin Barnes enters his third season at the helm of the Ionath Krakens. He's reshaped the team in his image, and the time for excuses is over; it's win, or be replaced. </p> <p>Quentin's championship quest carries him and his teammates across the galaxy in a brutal 12-game season fraught with injury and death. But he faces more than just on-field challenges. As he enters a free-agent year, several franchises vie for his services. Will he play for a new team, or will he remain with his beloved Krakens? And then there’s the slight distraction that someone, somewhere, is trying to assassinate him — and he doesn't know why.</p> <p>Performed by Michael John Casey, Joe Mallon, Michael Glenn, James Konicek, Cameron McNary, Matthew Shleigh, Nick DePinto, Terence Aselford, Eric Messner, Chris Genebach, Scott Graham, Jonathon Church, Audrey Bertaux, Thomas Keegan, Jonathan Feuer, Matthew Bassett, Ericka Rose, Alejandro Ruiz, Tony Nam, KenYatta Rogers, Maggie Donnelly, Nanette Savard, Nora Achrati, Tim Carlin, Danny Gavigan, Richard Rohan, Andy Brownstein, Kimberly Gilbert, Amanda Forstrom, Scott McCormick, Eric Singdahlsen, Colleen Delany, Jeff Allin, Laura C Harris, Brad Smith, Jacob Yeh, Mary C Davis, Chris Davenport, Ken Jackson, Terry Cammack.</p>";
