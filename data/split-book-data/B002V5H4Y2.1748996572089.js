window.bookSummaryJSON = "Once a brilliant scientist, Griffin has been gradually consumed by his research. When he finally achieves his goal, the final result is his departure from humanity. He feels no remorse in using his invisibility to gratify his increasing desires. As he gradually loses his mind, it is hard to determine if it is a result of his chemical concoction, or just a continuation of his moral decline. <p>At a time when science fiction was depicting what wonders the future would bring, H.G. Wells was one of the first writers to explore the dark side of science and portray how easily mortal man could be corrupted when tempted by seemingly unlimited power.</p>";
