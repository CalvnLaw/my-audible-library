window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</b></p> <p>Two centuries after the Confederation staved off an invasion by the robotic Locusts, Captain Jack Romanoff faces mandatory retirement from an ever-shrinking navy. Actions speak louder than words. The Confederation doesn’t think the Locusts are coming back.</p> <p><i>But what if the politicians are wrong?</i></p> <p>Snared in a scheme he doesn’t fully understand or trust, Jack gets his promotion, but it comes with a catch. With a crew of rejects, he must restore the most powerful warship humanity has ever built, after centuries of neglect and decay, before time runs out.</p> <p><b>If he fails, humanity might not need to worry about history repeating itself ever again.</b></p>";
