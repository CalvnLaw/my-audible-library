window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Refusing to accept the mass extinction of species as an inevitability, \"the world's greatest naturalist\" (Jeffrey Sachs) proposes a plan to save Earth's imperiled biosphere. <i>Half-Earth</i> resoundingly concludes the best-selling trilogy begun by <i>The Social Conquest of Earth</i> and <i>The Meaning of Human Existence</i>, a National Book Award finalist. </p> <p>History is not a prerogative of the human species, Edward O. Wilson declares in <i>Half-Earth</i>, a brave work that becomes a radical redefinition of human history. Demonstrating that we blindly ignore the histories of millions of other species, Wilson warns of a point of no return that is imminent. Angrily challenging the fashionable theories of anthropocenes, who contend that humans can survive alone in an Edenic bubble engineered for their own survival, Wilson documents that the biosphere does not belong to us. Yet, refusing to believe that our extinction is, as so many fear, predetermined, Wilson has written <i>Half-Earth</i> as a cri de coeur, proposing that the only solution to our impending \"sixth extinction\" is to increase the area of natural reserves to half the surface of the Earth. </p> <p>Suffused with a profound Darwinian understanding of our planet's fragility, <i>Half-Earth</i> is a transformative work that reverberates with an urgency like few other books. </p>";
