window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Finalist for the National Book Award: a work that has served as a literary cornerstone for the Vietnam generation. </p> <p><i>The 13th Valley</i> follows the terrifying Vietnam combat experiences of James Chelini, a telephone-systems installer who finds himself an infantryman in territory controlled by the North Vietnamese army. Spiraling deeper and deeper into a world of conflict and darkness, this harrowing account of Chelini's plunge and immersion into jungle warfare traces his evolution from a semipacifist to an all-out combat-crazed soldier. The seminal novel on the Vietnam experience, <i>The 13th Valley</i> is a classic that illuminates the war in Southeast Asia like no other book. It is the first title in Del Vecchio's Vietnam War Trilogy, which also includes <i>For the Sake of All Living Things</i>, about the Cambodian holocaust, and <i>Carry Me Home</i>, which addresses the aftermath of war. </p>";
