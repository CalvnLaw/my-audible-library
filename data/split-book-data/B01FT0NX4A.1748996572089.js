window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A tarnished legacy. A dangerous mission. The beginning of an epic destiny....</b></p> <p>Nobleman and born soldier Ben Stiger never backs down from a fight. Even as the son of an infamous imperial general, an outcast from society, he refuses to crumble under the unforgiving shadow of his once-powerful family’s disgrace. When he’s reassigned from his crack company to the struggling southern army, he’s eager to help turn the tide against a growing deadly rebellion. </p> <p>Supported by his faithful lieutenant, Eli, one of the last remaining elven rangers, and a holy Paladin on a quest for the High Father, Stiger fights to gain control of his new company, resentful and mediocre soldiers, who he must train and then lead on a desperate mission to reach an outpost cut off by the enemy. But as he force-marches his men through hostile territory, the veteran commander faces more than he ever expected: rebels, bandits, a magic relic from an age long gone, and an ancient evil freshly risen that has to potential to destroy the empire he loves and serves.</p> <p>Can one outcast hero make a difference and save his empire from annihilation?</p> <p><i>Stiger’s Tigers</i> is the engrossing first book in the Chronicles of an Imperial Officer epic fantasy series. If you like brave champions, sword and sorcery, breathtaking twists and turns, and authentic battle scenes, then you’ll love Marc Alan Edelheit’s Roman-inspired adventure series. </p> <p><i>Winner of the Independent Publisher Book Award for Fantasy.</i></p> <p><i>Finalist for Best Series Next Generation Indie Book Awards.</i> </p>";
