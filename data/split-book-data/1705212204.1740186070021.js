New Life. New Start. Getting a berth on the Intrepid is her ticket out of the Sol System.</p> <p>But nothing proves easy for Major Tanis Richards. Nothing is at it seems. What should be a simple trip is fraught with danger and filled with adventure. An array of forces seek to stop the Intrepid - no matter the cost, or lives lost. From competing corporations, to stellar eco-terrorists, no one wants the Intrepid to arrive at New Eden.</p> <p>Through their journey, the crew of the Intrepid will face rival stellar governments, civil war, and the most wanted serial killer known to the galaxy. Pivoting their role from colonists to saviors.</p> <p>Perhaps it's because the Intrepid carries the most valuable secret known to humanity. Or maybe it's just Tanis's luck.</p>";
