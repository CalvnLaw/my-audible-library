window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Presenting Edgar Award-winning editor Otto Penzler's latest anthology, <i>The Big Book of Sherlock Holmes Stories</i>, the largest collection of Sherlockian tales ever.</b> </p> <p>Arguably no other character in history has been so enduringly popular as Sherlock Holmes. From his first appearance in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1887 novella <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, fans have loved reading and listening about him - and writers have loved writing about him. Here, Otto Penzler collects 83 wonderful stories about Holmes and Dr. John Watson, the majority of which will be new to listeners. Inside this audio are tales by acclaimed Sherlockians Leslie S. Klinger, Laurie R. King, Lyndsay Faye, and Daniel Stashower; pastiches by literary luminaries both classic (Kenneth Millar, P. G. Wodehouse, Dorothy B. Hughes) and current (Anne Perry, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman); and parodies by Conan Doyle's contemporaries James M. Barrie, O. Henry, and August Derleth. </p>";
