window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First published in 1998, this perennial best seller distills more than 400 exciting tales of heroism from the 150,000 search-and-rescue missions carried out by the National Park Service since Yellowstone was established as the first national park in 1872. Updated to include the most notable incidents through 2004 (including the Park Service's efforts to protect the nation's treasures following 9/11), the new edition features recent rescues and rescue attempts from the icy slopes of Mt. Rainer to the seas off of Acadia National Park.</p>";
