Here are the best stories and every major writer who ever appeared in celebrated Pulps like <i>Black Mask</i>, <i>Dime Detective</i>, <i>Detective Fiction Weekly</i>, and more. These are the classic tales that created the genre and gave birth to hard-hitting detectives who smoke criminals like packs of cigarettes; sultry dames whose looks are as lethal as a dagger to the chest; and gin-soaked hideouts where conversations are just preludes to murder. This is crime fiction at its gritty best.</p> <p>Including:</p> <ul> <li>Three stories by Raymond Chandler, Cornell Woolrich, Erle Stanley Gardner, and Dashiell Hammett</li> <li>Complete novels from Carroll John Daly, the man who invented the hard-boiled detective, and Fredrick Nebel, one of the masters of the form</li> <li>A new Dashiell Hammett story</li> <li>Every other major pulp writer of the time, including Paul Cain, Steve Fisher, James M.
