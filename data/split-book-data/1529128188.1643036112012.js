window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>BBC radio productions of H. G. Wells' finest fiction - plus hear H G Wells in his own words in a selection of original radio broadcasts from the 1930s and 40s.</b></p> <p>H. G. Wells is one of the founding fathers of science fiction, renowned for his futuristic tales in which he predicted space travel, lasers, the atomic bomb and wireless communication. But in addition to his 'scientific romances', he also wrote numerous ghost stories, domestic comedies and Utopian novels espousing his ideals of socialism and feminism.</p> <p>This collection features a selection of his best works from across these genres. Here are dramatisations of his sci-fi and fantasy classics, <i>The Time Machine, The Wonderful Visit, The Island of Dr Moreau, The War of the Worlds</i> and <i>The First Men in the Moon</i>, with stellar casts including <b>Robert Glenister, Bernard Cribbins, Garard Green, Blake Ritson</b> and <b>Hywel Bennett</b>, as well as a reading by <b>Stephen Murray</b> of <i>The Invisible Man</i>.</p> <p>Wells' comic novels of lower middle-class life are represented by <i>Love and Mr Lewisham</i> (read by <b>Paul Daneman</b>), and adaptations of <i>Kipps, Tono-Bungay</i> and <i>The History of Mr Polly</i>, starring<b> Mark Straker, Neil Dudgeon</b> and <b>Christopher Guinee</b>. Also included is a dramatisation of his 'New Woman' novel <i>Ann Veronica</i>, with <b>Amy Hoggart </b>as the eponymous heroine and <b>Bill Nighy</b> as the Narrator.</p> <p>One of Wells' most famous supernatural short stories,<i> The Inexperienced Ghost</i>, is dramatised with a full cast including<b> Donald Houston</b> and <b>Christopher Guard</b>, and four further short tales - <i>In the Abyss, The Sea Raiders, A Dream of Armageddon </i>and<i> The New Accelerator</i> - are read by <b>Timothy Keightley</b> and <b>Robert Bathurst</b>.</p> <p>In the fascinating documentary <i>H G Wells: The Invisible Author</i>, Brian Morton asks whether the focus on Wells' science fiction has overshadowed his other authorial achievements. And we hear Wells in his own words as he discusses topics as diverse as world politics, the history of the printing press, the possibilities of technology and the shape of things to come....</p> <p>Lastly, Martyn Wade's original drama <i>The Wells Way</i> brings H. G. Wells and George Gissing together at crisis points in their lives, as each tries to be more like the other. <b>Julian Rhind-Tutt </b>stars as Wells, with <b>Joseph Millson</b> as Gissing.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Contents:</b><br> <i> The Time Machine</i><br> <i> The Wonderful Visit</i><br> <i> The Island of Dr Moreau</i><br> <i> The Invisible Man</i><br> <i> The War of the Worlds</i><br> <i> Love and Mr Lewisham</i><br> <i> The First Men in the Moon</i><br> <i> Kipps</i><br> <i> Tono-Bungay</i><br> <i> Ann Veronica</i><br> <i> The History of Mr Polly</i><br> <i> In the Abyss</i><br> <i> The Sea Raiders</i><br> <i> A Dream of Armageddon</i><br> <i> The New Accelerator</i><br> <i> The Inexperienced Ghost</i><br> <i> H G Wells: The Invisible Author</i><br> Radio speeches by H G Wells<br> <i>The Wells Way</i> by Martin Wade</p> <p>With thanks to Keith Wickham</p>";
