window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new fully updated narrative edition of David Attenborough’s seminal biography of our world, </b><b><i>Living Planet</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Nowhere on our planet is devoid of life. Plants and animals thrive or survive within every extreme of climate and habitat that it offers. Single species, and often whole communities, adapt to make the most of ice cap and tundra, forest and plain, desert, ocean and volcano. These adaptations can be truly extraordinary: fish that walk or lay eggs on leaves in mid-air, snakes that fly, flightless birds that graze like deer and bears that grow hair on the soles of their feet.</p> <p>In <i>Living Planet</i>, David Attenborough’s searching eye, unfailing curiosity and infectious enthusiasm explain and illuminate the intricate lives of the these colonies, from the lonely heights of the Himalayas to the wild creatures that have established themselves in the most recent of environments, the city. By the end of this book, it is difficult to say which is the more astonishing - the ingenuity with which individual species contrive a living, or the complexity of their interdependence on each other and on the habitations provided by our planet.</p> <p>In this new edition, the author, with the help of zoologist Matthew Cobb, has added all the most up-to-date discoveries of ecology and biology. He also addresses the urgent issues facing our living planet: climate change, pollution and mass extinction of species.</p>";
