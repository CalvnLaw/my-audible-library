window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Living at the limits of our ordinary perception, mosses are a common but largely unnoticed element of the natural world.<i> Gathering Moss</i> is a beautifully written mix of science and personal reflection that invites listeners to explore and learn from the elegantly simple lives of mosses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Robin Wall Kimmerer's audiobook is not an identification guide, nor is it a scientific treatise. Rather, it is a series of linked personal essays that will lead general listeners and scientists alike to an understanding of how mosses live and how their lives are intertwined with the lives of countless other beings, from salmon and hummingbirds to redwoods and rednecks. Kimmerer clearly and artfully explains the biology of mosses, while at the same time reflecting on what these fascinating organisms have to teach us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on her diverse experiences as a scientist, mother, teacher, and writer of Native American heritage, Kimmerer explains the stories of mosses in scientific terms as well as in the framework of indigenous ways of knowing. In her audiobook, the natural history and cultural relationships of mosses become a powerful metaphor for ways of living in the world.</p>";
