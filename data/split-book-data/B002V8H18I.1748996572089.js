window.bookSummaryJSON = "If you happen to find a map in a dead buccaneer's sea trunk, you can't very well ignore it, not if you are Jim Hawkins and his friends Dr. Livesey, Captain Smollett, and Squire Trelawney! But even with a map, buried treasures are not easy things to come by. At the start of his grand adventure, setting sail on the good ship <i>Hispaniola</i>, the young Hawkins is a hesitant, querulous boy, too easily beguiled by his own fancy. <p>By journey's end he will have faced murder, mutiny, and mayhem - and in the process, become a man. Narrator Neil Hunt brings to life the characters Robert Louis Stevenson made so memorable: Black Dog, Blind Pew, Billy Bones, George Merry, Israel Hands, and Ben Gunn.</p>";
