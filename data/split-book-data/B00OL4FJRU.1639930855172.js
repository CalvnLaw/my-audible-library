window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This user’s guide to Buddhist basics takes the most commonly asked questions - beginning with “What is the essence of the Buddha’s teachings?” - and provides simple answers in plain English. Thubten Chodron’s responses to the questions that always seem to arise among people approaching Buddhism make this an exceptionally complete and accessible introduction - as well as a manual for living a more peaceful, mindful, and satisfying Life. <i>Buddhism for Beginners</i> is an ideal first book on the subject for anyone, but it’s also a wonderful resource for seasoned students, since the question-and-answer format makes it easy to find just the topic you’re looking for, such as: </p> <ul> <li>What is the goal of the Buddhist path? </li> <li>What is karma? </li> <li>If all phenomena are empty, does that mean nothing exists? </li> <li>How can we deal with fear? </li> <li>How do I establish a regular meditation practice? </li> <li>What are the qualities I should look for in a teacher? </li> <li>What is Buddha-nature? </li> <li>Why can't we remember our past lives? </li> </ul> <p></p>";
