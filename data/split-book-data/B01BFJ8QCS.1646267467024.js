window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Ember War</i>, book 1: The Earth is doomed. Humanity has a chance. </p> <p>In the near future, an alien probe arrives on Earth with a pivotal mission: to determine if humanity has what it takes to survive the impending invasion by a merciless armada. The probe discovers Marc Ibarra, a young inventor who holds the key to a daring gambit that could save a fraction of Earth's population. Humanity's only chance lies with Ibarra's ability to keep a terrible secret and engineer the planet down the narrow path to survival. Earth will need a fleet. One with a hidden purpose. One strong enough to fight a battle against annihilation. </p> <p><i>The Ember War</i> is the first installment in an epic military sci-fi series. If you enjoyed <i>A Hymn Before Battle</i> by John Ringo and <i>The Last Starship</i> by Vaughn Heppner, then you'll love this explosive adventure with constant thrills and high stakes from beginning to end. </p> <p><i>The Ruins of Anthalas</i>, book 2: An ancient holocaust holds the key to humanity's survival. </p> <p>Only a sliver of mankind survived the Xaros invasion. With Earth's defenses in ashes, nothing can stop the aliens' inevitable return. Hope arrives through a cryptic message from a long-lost alien race, promising the means to rebuild the shattered space fleet. Captain Valdar takes one of the last strike carriers, the <i>Breitenfeld</i>, and his shell-shocked crew on a desperate mission to the dead world. Unfortunately humans aren't the only power that received the ancient message.... </p> <p><i>The Ruins of Anthalas</i> is the second book in The Ember War Saga, a military sci-fi space opera.
