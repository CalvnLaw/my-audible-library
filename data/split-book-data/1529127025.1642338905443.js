window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A radio anthology of George Orwell's finest novels, memoirs and essays, plus four biographical dramas and a bonus documentary, <i>The Road to Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>.</p> <p>Visionary author and journalist George Orwell was the man behind two of the best loved and most influential novels of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> and <i>Animal Farm</i>. This collection celebrating his life and work features dramatisations of both these classic books, with stellar casts including Christopher Eccleston, Pippa Nixon, Tim Pigott-Smith, Tamsin Greig and Nicky Henson.</p> <p>Also included is a drama based on his autobiographical account of the Spanish Civil War, <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>, starring Joseph Millson and Lyndsey Marshal. Four biographical radio plays by Mike Walker and Jonathan Holloway - <i>Burma</i>, <i>Dreaming</i>, <i>Loving</i> and <i>Jura</i> - explore further episodes in Orwell's fascinating life, showing the disconnection between the man who was Eric Blair and the writer who was George Orwell.</p> <p>Timeless examples of his essays and journalism are showcased here, including 'A Hanging', 'Confessions of a Book Reviewer', 'My Country Right or Left', 'Pleasure Spots' and 'As I Please' (all read by Clive Merrison), while Joseph Millson narrates <i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i>, Orwell's vivid memoir of his time living among the poor in Europe's two great cities.</p> <p>Finally, in <i>The Road to Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, David Aaronovitch examines what led avowed socialist George Orwell to write a book beloved of the Right, revealing how the novel grew from a forgotten political world shaped by the atom bomb.</p> <p>George Orwell worked for BBC Radio from August 1941 to November 1943, and even went on air himself. Sadly, none of the programmes in which he took part survive - in those days, radio was essentially a live medium and broadcasts were not recorded for posterity. But Orwell's connection to the BBC remains a fascinating part of its wartime history.</p>";
