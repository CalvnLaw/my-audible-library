window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p><p><b>For the first time—in honor of the late Matthew Mather, the master of technothrillers—all three titles in the exhilarating Delta Devlin series are now available in a discounted box set.</b></p> <p><b>With a new foreword written by </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><b> bestselling author Nicholas Sansbury Smith, this is a series worth losing your head over.</b></p> <p><b>Book 1: </b><i><b>The Dreaming Tree</b></i></p> <p>After a near-fatal car crash, Royce Lowell-Vandeweghe wakes up to find he’s one of the first patients to undergo a radical new procedure: a full-body transplant. Convalescing years later and suffering from waking nightmares, he answers the door at his Long Island home and meets Delta Devlin, a New York detective. She sees things nobody else can—visions created by a mutation to her eyes—and meeting Royce sets off an unraveling chain of events …</p> <p><b>Book 2: </b><i><b>Meet Your Maker</b></i></p> <p>Interpol rookie Delta Devlin witnesses an attempted assassination, but the bullet meant for the Ukrainian prime minister hits her father instead, lodging next to his heart. Investigations reveal that ex–KGB operator Yuri Korshunov smuggled a 3D-printed plastic gun into the UN Building. As her father falls into a mysterious coma, Devlin follows Korshunov and infamous tech wunderkind Lenny Bondar into the underworld of Eastern Europe. There, her worst nightmares materialize from the darkness.</p> <p><b>Book 3:</b><i><b> Out of Time</b></i></p> <p>Critical components of the Large Hadron Collider, the largest machine ever built, have been stolen, and newly promoted Marshal Delta Devlin is brought in by Interpol to investigate. At the same time, a dead body appears on the shores of the East River in Delta’s hometown of New York City—one with very similar injuries to those left by the serial killer she caught to start her career. As events in the present collide in a tangle of secrets and lies, Delta cannot trust anyone—even her family and loved ones.</p><p></p>";
