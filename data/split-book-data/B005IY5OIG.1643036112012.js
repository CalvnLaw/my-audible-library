window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of the bestselling and award-winning <i>Matterhorn</i> comes a brilliant nonfiction book about war and the psychological and spiritual toll it takes on those who fight.</p> <p>“I wrote this book primarily to come to terms with my own experience of combat. So far—reading, writing, thinking—that has taken over thirty years.”</p> <p>In 1969, at the age of twenty-three, Karl Marlantes was dropped into the highland jungle of Vietnam, an inexperienced lieutenant in command of a platoon of forty marines who would live or die by his decisions. Marlantes survived, but like many of his brothers in arms, he has spent the last forty years dealing with his war experience. In his first work of nonfiction, Marlantes takes a deeply personal and candid look at what it is like to experience the ordeal of combat, critically examining how we might better prepare our soldiers for war.</p> <p>Just as <i>Matterhorn</i> is already acclaimed a classic of war literature, <i>What It Is Like to Go to War</i> is set to become required reading for anyone—soldier or civilian—interested in this visceral and all-too-essential part of the human experience.</p> <p>Karl Marlantes, a cum laude graduate of Yale University and Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, was a marine in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten Air Medals. He has lived and traveled all over the world and now writes full time. He and his wife, Anne, have five children and live on a small lake in Washington.</p>";
