As much as the Sultan wants to kill her, each night he is drawn in by her tales and spares them. Scheherezade weaves a long, winding and exciting tale about Sinbad the Sailor, a reckless young man who has inherited his father’s wealth and spends it foolishly. His debts eventually force him to leave Baghdad and find his way alone. However, his journey quickly takes a turn when he is led to sea by a mysterious woman dressed in blue, which begins his long and dramatic adventures at sea.</p> <p>Starring Abraham Popoola, Adam Sina, Akin Gazi, Alyssa Kyria, Anoushka Rava, Aso Sherabayani, Bamshad Abedi-Amin, Daniel Naddafy, David Ahmad, Firdous Bamji, Gisele Payvandi, Hakan Silahsiz Hemi Yeroham, Ian Abeysekera Jonathan Morrison, Josh Zare Karim Kronfli, Mandana Jones Nezar Alderazi, Raghad Chaar Richard Reed, Sammy Broly, Tara Jaffar and Walles Hamonde.</p> <p><i>[Please note this drama contains some explicit content.]</i></p>";
