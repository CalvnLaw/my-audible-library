window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First published in 1903, this groundbreaking work is a cornerstone of African American literary history and a foundational text in the field of sociology. In these fourteen essays, W. E. B. Du Bois introduces and explores the concept of “double-consciousness” - a term he uses to describe the experience of living as an African American and having a “sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others.”</p> <p>Though an examination of Black life in post-Civil War America, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> has had a lasting impact on civil rights and the discussion of race in the United States.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>The Souls of Black Folk</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>The Souls of Black Folk (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
