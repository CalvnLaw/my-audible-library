window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What would happen if you admitted you weren't a good person? </b></p> <p>It's a seemingly crazy question. From priests to prisoners, nearly everyone thinks they're morally better than average. Why change our minds? Why admit the truth about ourselves? </p> <p>In his conversational and delightfully self-effacing style, Brant Hansen shows us why we should fight our drive to be self-righteous: it's breathtakingly freeing. What's more, just admitting that we're profoundly biased toward ourselves and want desperately to preserve our rightness at all costs even helps us think better, make better decisions, be better listeners, and improve our relationships with God and others. </p> <p>Hansen draws from biblical insight and the work of everyone from esteemed social psychologists to comedians to make his point: the sooner we get over ourselves, give up the I'm good internal dialogue, and admit the truth, the sooner we can live a more lighthearted, fruitful, fun-loving life. After all, as Hansen writes, the humble life is truly your best one.</p>";
