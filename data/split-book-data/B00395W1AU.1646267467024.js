window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his articles and in best-selling books such as <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, Michael Pollan has established himself as one of our most important and beloved writers on modern man's place in the natural world. A new literary classic, <i>Second Nature</i> has become a manifesto not just for gardeners but for environmentalists everywhere.</p> <p> Chosen by the American Horticultural Society as one of the 75 greatest books ever written about gardening, <i>Second Nature</i> captures the rhythms of our everyday engagement with the outdoors in all its glory and exasperation. With chapters ranging from a reconsideration of the Great American Lawn, a dispatch from one man's war with a woodchuck, to an essay about the sexual politics of roses, Pollan has created a passionate and eloquent argument for reconceiving our relationship with nature.</p>";
