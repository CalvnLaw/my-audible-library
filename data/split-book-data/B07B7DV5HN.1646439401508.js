window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are qualities we all yearn to experience in our lives - peace, simplicity, grace, connection, clarity. Yet these qualities evade us, because each of them arises from an experience of wholeness, and we live in a culture that enforces divisions within each of us.</p> <p>In <i>Radical Wholeness</i>, Philip Shepherd shows the countless ways in which we are persuaded to separate from the body and live in the head. Disconnected from the body's intelligence, we also disconnect from the wholeness of the present. This schism within us is the primary source of stress not just in our personal lives, but for the systems of the planet.</p> <p>Drawing from neuroscience, anthropology, physics, the arts, myth, personal stories, and his experiences helping people around the world to experience wholeness, Philip Shepherd illuminates what true wholeness means and offers practices designed to help listeners soften into the intelligence of the body. <i>Radical Wholeness</i> is a call to action: to recover wholeness and experience a new way of being.</p>";
