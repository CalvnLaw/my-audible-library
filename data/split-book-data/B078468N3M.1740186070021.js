window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over the course of history, yellow fever has paralyzed governments, halted commerce, quarantined cities, moved the U.S. capital, and altered the outcome of wars. During a single summer in Memphis alone, it cost more lives than the Chicago fire, the San Francisco earthquake, and the Johnstown flood combined. </p> <p>In 1900, the U.S. sent three doctors to Cuba to discover how yellow fever was spread. There, they launched one of history's most controversial human studies. Compelling and terrifying, <i>The American Plague</i> depicts the story of yellow fever and its reign in this country - and in Africa, where even today it strikes thousands every year. With \"arresting tales of heroism,\" it is a story as much about the nature of human beings as it is about the nature of disease. </p>";
