window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>L. E. Modesitt, Jr.'s best-selling fantasy novels set in the magical world of Recluce have established a standard of entertainment in contemporary fantasy. Each Recluce novel tells an independent story that nevertheless reverberates through all the other Recluce novels to deepen and enrich the listener's experience.</b></p> <p>Now, in <i>Fall of Angels</i>, Modesitt moves deep into Recluce's past to chronicle the founding of the Empire of the Legend, the almost mythological domain ruled by women warriors on the highland plateau of the continent of Candar. He tells the story from the point of view of Nylan, the engineer and builder whose job it is to raise a great tower on the plateau known as the Roof of the World. Here the exiled women warriors will live and survive to fulfill their destiny. Here a revolutionary new society will be born...if Nylan can get the tower built and defenses in place before the rulers of the lowland nations come with their armies to obliterate them all. And if Nylan can learn to control the magical powers that are growing within him. </p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Christopher Walker as Nylan, Eva Wilhelm, Jessica Lauren Ball, Zeke Alton, and Lydia Kraniotis, Alejandro Ruiz, Matthew Schleigh, Lise Bruneau, Marni Penning, Danny Gavigan, Rob McFadyen, Nora Achrati, Holly Adams, James Konicek, Laura C.
