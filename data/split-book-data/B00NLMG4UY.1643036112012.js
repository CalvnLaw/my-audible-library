window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This classic samurai-era text fused Japanese swordsmanship with Zen and influenced the direction that the art has taken ever since. Written by the 17th-century Zen master Takuan Soho (1573-1645), <i>The Unfettered Mind</i> is a book of advice on swordsmanship and the cultivation of right mind and intention. It was written as a guide for the samurai Yagyu Munenori, who was a great swordsman and rival to the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Takuan was a giant in the history of Zen; he was also a gardener, calligrapher, poet, author, adviser to samurai and shoguns, and a pivotal figure in Zen painting. He was known for his brilliance and acerbic wit. In these succinct and pointed essays, Takuan is concerned primarily with understanding and refining the mind - both generally and when faced with conflict. <i>The Unfettered Mind</i> was a major influence on the classic manifestos on swordsmanship that came after it, including Miyamoto Musashi's <i>Book of Five Rings</i> and Yagyu Munenori's <i>Life-Giving Sword</i>. </p>";
