window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Join three literary scholars and award-winning professors as they introduce you to dozens of short masterpieces that you can finish - and engage with - in a day or less. Perfect for people with busy lives who still want to discover -or rediscover - just how transformative reading can be, these 36 lectures range from short stories of fewer than 10 pages to novellas and novels of around 200 pages. Despite their short length, these works are powerful examinations of the same subjects and themes that longer \"great books\" discuss. </p> <p> And with three great professors coming together to offer their own looks at literature, you'll get a multitude of ways to approach and think about grand human themes, including </p> <ul> <li>the nature of love and the mysteries of fate; </li> <li>the riddle of identity and the trials of growing up; </li> <li>the complex ties between individuals and their societies; </li> <li>the ways we make sense of personal and public history. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In the company of these three professors, you'll also approach the evolution of the modern novel, the development of literary genres such as graphic novels and creative nonfiction, the role of politics and culture in inspiring authors, and much more. </p> <p></p>What's more, by exploring literature through three perspectives instead of one, you'll get an opportunity to see how literature professors - just like everyone else - approach and read books in their own unique way. It's like getting three distinct learning experiences, all in one single, affordable package. <p></p>";
