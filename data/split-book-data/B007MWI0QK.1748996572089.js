window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this side-splitting memoir, the former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> star recounts the hilarious adventures and unexpected joy of dating and becoming a mother when she least expected it - at the age of 44. </p> <p>Anyone who saw an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> between 1999 and 2006 knows Rachel Dratch. She was hilarious! So what happened to her? After a misbegotten part as Jenna on the pilot of <i>30 Rock,</i> Dratch was only getting offered roles as \"Lesbians. Secretaries. Sometimes secretaries who are lesbians.\" </p> <p>Her career at a low point, Dratch suddenly had time for yoga, dog-sitting, learning Spanish - and dating. After all, what did a forty-something single woman living in New York have to lose? Resigned to childlessness but still hoping for romance, Dratch was out for drinks with a friend when she met John. </p> <p>Handsome and funny, after only six months of dating long-distance, he became the inadvertent father of her wholly unplanned, undreamed-of child and moved to New York to be a dad. With riotous humor, Dratch recounts breaking the news to her bewildered parents, the awe of her single friends, and the awkwardness of a baby-care class where the instructor kept tossing out the f-word. </p> <p>Filled with great behind-the-scenes anecdotes from Dratch's time on <i>SNL,</i> Girl Walks into a Bar is a refreshing version of the \"happily ever after\" story that proves female comics - like best sellers Tina Fey and Chelsea Handler - are truly having their moment.</p>";
