window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Middle Ages re-created through the cast of pilgrims in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.</p> <p>Among the surviving records of 14th-century England, Geoffrey Chaucer's poetry is the most vivid. Chaucer wrote about everyday people outside the walls of the English court-men and women who spent days at the pedal of a loom, or maintaining the ledgers of an estate, or on the high seas. In <i>Chaucer's People</i>, Liza Picard transforms <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> into a masterful guide for a gloriously detailed tour of medieval England, from the mills and farms of a manor house to the lending houses and Inns of Court in London.</p> <p>In <i>Chaucer's People</i>, we meet again the motley crew of pilgrims on the road to Canterbury. Drawing on a range of historical records such as the Magna Carta, <i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i>, and <i>Cookery in English</i>, Picard puts Chaucer's characters into historical context and mines them for insights into what people ate, wore, read, and thought in the Middle Ages. What can the Miller, \"big . . . of brawn and eke of bones\" tell us about farming in 14th-century England? What do we learn of medieval diets and cooking methods from the Cook? With boundless curiosity and wit, Picard re-creates the religious, political, and financial institutions and customs that gave order to these lives.</p>";
