window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rediscover one of literature’s most beloved classics, richly reissued in a pivotal new audio recording. Emmy and Tony Award-nominated actor Pablo Schreiber (<i>The Wire</i>, <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>) delivers a stirring performance of Jack London’s fierce yet tender tale of loyalty between man and beast, told from the point of view of a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Call of the Wild</i> remains one of London’s best-loved novels, often regarded as the crowning masterpiece of a writer whose enduring popularity and prolific output hold a unique place in American literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>On its face, the novel is the story of Buck, a dog stolen from his comfortable home on a California ranch and shipped to the frozen Yukon to be a trained as a sled dog. But this exhilarating tale of a canine hero’s fight for survival is in fact a vivid depiction of the great gold rush to the Klondike in 1897. Brutal and fierce on one hand, this iconic adventure story is also a heart-warming tale of the tenderness and loyalty between humans and animals, brilliantly told from the latter’s perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrator Schreiber, whose previous performance of Brett Easton Ellis’ <i>American Psycho</i> has endeared him to listeners, brings a classic American tale to the ears - and hearts - of a new generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
