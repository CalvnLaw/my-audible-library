Huron must call on every trick he knows to stay in control—and alive. Yet even a warrior as ferocious and opportunistic as the Blood Reaver must be wary, for although there are many bargains he can strike, all power comes at a price....</p> <p>Written by Mike Brooks. Narrated by Andrew Wincott. Running time 6 hours and 24 minutes.</p>";
