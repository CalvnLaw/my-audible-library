window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Battle Royale,</i> a high-octane thriller about senseless youth violence in a dystopian world, it is one of Japan's best-selling - and most controversial - novels. As part of a ruthless program by the totalitarian government, ninth-grade students are taken to a small isolated island with a map, food, and various weapons. Forced to wear special collars that explode when they break a rule, they must fight each other for three days until only one \"winner\" remains. The elimination contest becomes the ultimate in must-see reality television. </p> <p>A Japanese pulp classic available in English-language audio for the first time, <i>Battle Royale</i> is a potent allegory of what it means to be young and survive in today's dog-eat-dog world. The first novel by small-town journalist Koushun Takami, it went on to become an even more notorious film by 70-year-old director Kinji Fukusaku.</p>";
