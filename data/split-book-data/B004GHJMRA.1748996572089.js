window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Of all the hosts of Eurotas, the Troias were the most fell. For they were born of Winter.</i> </p> <p>Between the Solar Array Pumped Laser and Troy, the two-trillion-ton nickel-iron battlestation created by eccentric billionaire Tyler Vernon, Earth has managed to recapture the Sol system from their Horvath conquerors and has begun entering the galactic millieu. But when the Rangora Empire rapidly crushes humanity's only ally, it becomes clear the war is just beginning. </p> <p>At the heart of nickel, iron, and starlight are the people, Marines, Navy, and civilians who make Troy a living, breathing, engine of war. Survivors of apocalypse, they know the cost of failure. If this Troy falls, no one will be left to write the epic. </p> <p>Citadel continues the saga begun in <i>Live Free or Die</i>, following the paths of several characters during the first years of The Spiral Arm Wars, culminating in the First Battle of E Eridani.</p>";
