window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Contains all three books in the Waking Late trilogy.</p> <p><i>Sleeping Duty</i> (book one) </p> <p>Gilead Tan and Andrea Fielding survived their stint in the military, got married, signed up to emigrate to a terraformed colony world, and went into cold sleep for the journey from Earth. While they slept, the starship went through the wrong fold in space and settled for a different world, a wild world.</p> <p>Three centuries after the founding of a colony on the uncharted planet, Gilead awakens to find humanity slipped back to medieval tech and a feudal structure.</p> <p>Worse, the king who wants Gilead awake won’t let Gilead awaken his wife.</p> <p><i>Out of the Dell</i> (book two) </p> <p>On the planet Nwwwlf, in the lost colony of First Landing, the original settlers carved out one sylvan valley, a lone outpost where humans flourish. But their bright hopes and best intentions devolved over centuries into a rude replica of medieval feudalism.</p> <p>Gilead Tan, who had been held captive for centuries in his sleeping cell, survived treachery and pain to free a small group of sleepers. But he and his friends now face the perils of life outside First Landing’s sanctuary - without their powered armor, their tools and technology, or anything else they need save for a few chickens.</p> <p>Gilead must establish a safehold for his crew, but the alien environment does not welcome them, and petty bickering threatens their meager resources. He hopes that a trace of smoke - spotted above a distant ridge - beckons them to a better place.</p> <p>It doesn't.</p> <p><i>Like a Continental Soldier</i> (book three) </p> <p>The starship Valerie Hall failed to reach the terraformed world of its original destination. Instead, it found a habitable substitute where the settlers split into two factions. First Landing devolved into a rude replica of medieval despotism. Seccon might promise more.</p> <p>Or so hope Gilead Tan and his companions.</p> <p>Gilead spent three centuries in cold sleep, held there by a First Landing custom that decreed only one sleeper could be awakened every 50 years. Once awake, Gilead freed two dozen of his fellows - all soldiers like himself - and led them into the wilderness.</p> <p>Close to 200 civilians still lie trapped in the decaying cryo-cells of First Landing. Their captive slumber haunts him.</p> <p>But despite its vaunted freedom, Seccon has one rule. No one goes back to First Landing.</p>";
