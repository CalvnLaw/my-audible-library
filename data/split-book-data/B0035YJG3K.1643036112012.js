window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Live each day as if it were your last.\" Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, Marcus Aurelius's <i>Meditations</i> offers a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. </p> <p>Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus's own emotions. But while <i>The Meditations</i> was composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers, and readers throughout the centuries.</p>";
