Yet she is only mortal, performing no miracles, untouched by divinity, and though she was chosen not by the Master of Mankind but by his living thralls, the faith is hers to command and to protect.</p> <p>LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE</p> <p>It’s a story of doubt and faith. It’s a story of the light of the God-Emperor against the darkness of the Night Lords. Can Morvenn Vahl lead the faithful to triumph, or will Ophelia VII fall to the traitors?</p> <p>THE STORY</p> <p>When a monster from myth threatens the cardinal world of Ophelia VII, Morvenn Vahl defies the Senatorum Imperialis and heads to the planet's defence. There, she finds a world in terror – the warlord Kol Rakhul, known as the Death of Saints, has come for the faithful and, with his Heldrake and a host of Night Lords at his back, plans to enshroud the world in flame and blood.</p> <p>This is a reckoning. A holy world is being defiled, and in its defence, Morvenn Vahl must wield an army of Living Saints to stand a hope of survival, let alone victory.</p>";
