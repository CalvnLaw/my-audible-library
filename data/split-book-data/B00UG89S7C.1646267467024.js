window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Untouched by Human Hands</i> consists of 13 stories of beings who dwell on the strange borders of reality. Some of these stories tell of people you know or of events that might happen - but haven't yet. Some will take you to the furthermost reaches of the sky and to planets whose names are unknown this side of Arcturus. And some - perhaps the richest and most memorable of these stories - open into the interior of strange minds to reveal the reflection of ourselves. </p> <p>This classic collection consists of the following short stories: </p> <ul> <li> \"The Monsters\" </li> <li>\"Cost of Living\" </li> <li>\"The Altar\" </li> <li>\"Shape\" </li> <li>\"The Impacted Man\" </li> <li>\"Untouched by Human Hands\" </li> <li>\"The King's Wishes\" </li> <li>\"Warm\" </li> <li>\"The Demons\" </li> <li>\"Specialist\" </li> <li>\"Seventh Victim\" </li> <li>\"Ritual\" </li> <li>\"Beside Still Waters\" </li> </ul> <p></p>";
