window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A \"masterly\" (</b><b><i>Economist</i></b><b>), prize-winning, internationally bestselling history of books in the ancient world<br> <br> \"Exquisite. . . . Beautifully translated into English by Charlotte Whittle, who is able to convey both Vallejo’s passionate narrative presence and her synthesising intelligence.” —</b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br> <br> Long before books were mass-produced, hand-copied scrolls made from Nile River reeds were the treasures of the ancient world. Emperors and pharaohs, determined to possess them, dispatched emissaries to the edges of the known world to bring them back. Exploring the deep and fascinating history of the written word, from the oral tradition to scrolls to codices, internationally bestselling author Irene Vallejo shows that books have always been a precious and precarious vehicle for civilization.<br> <br> Through fascinating stories from history, insightful readings of the classics, and poignant personal reflection, Vallejo traces the dramatic history of the book and the fight for its survival. At its heart a spirited love letter to language itself, <i>Papyrus </i>takes listeners on a journey across the centuries to discover how a simple reed grown along the banks of the Nile would give birth to a rich and cherished culture.</p>";
