window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller </b><b><i>The Hidden Life of Trees </i></b></p> <p><b>A powerful return to the forest, where trees have heartbeats and roots are like brains that extend underground. Where the color green calms us, and the forest sharpens our senses. </b></p> <p>In <i>The Heartbeat of Trees, </i>renowned forester Peter Wohlleben draws on new scientific discoveries to show how humans are deeply connected to the natural world. In an era of climate change, many of us fear we’ve lost our connection to nature - but Peter Wohlleben is convinced that age-old ties linking humans to the forest remain alive and intact. We just have to know where to look.</p> <p>Drawing on science and cutting-edge research, <i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i> reveals the profound interactions humans can have with nature, exploring:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>The language of the forest</li> <li>The consciousness of plants</li> <li>And the eroding boundary between flora and fauna.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>A perfect book to take with you into the woods, <i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i> shares how to see, feel, smell, hear, and even taste the forest.</p> <p>Peter Wohlleben, renowned for his ability to write about trees in an engaging and moving way, reveals a wondrous cosmos where humans are a part of nature, and where conservation and environmental activism is not just about saving trees - it’s about saving ourselves, too.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i></b></p> <p>“As human beings, we’re desperate to feel that we’re not alone in the universe. And yet we are surrounded by an ongoing conversation that we can sense if, as Peter Wohlleben so movingly prescribes, we listen to the heartbeat of all life.” (Richard Louv, author of <i>Our Wild Calling </i>and<i> Last Child in the Woods</i>)</p> <p>“Astonishment after astonishment - that is the great gift of <i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i>. It is both a celebration of the wonders of trees, and a howl of outrage at how recklessly we profane them.” (Kathleen Dean Moore, author of <i>Earth’s Wild Music</i>)</p> <p>“As Peter Wohlleben reminds us in <i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i>, trees are the vocabulary of nature as forests are the brainbank of a living planet. This was the codex of the ancient world, and it must be the fine focus of our future.” (Dr. Diana Beresford-Kroeger, author of <i>To Speak for the Trees </i>and <i>The Global Forest</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Peter Wohlleben knows the battle that lies before us: forging a closer relationship with nature before we destroy it. In <i>The Heartbeat of Trees</i> he takes us deep into the global forest to show us how.” (Jim Robbins, author of <i>The Man Who Planted Trees</i>)</p>";
