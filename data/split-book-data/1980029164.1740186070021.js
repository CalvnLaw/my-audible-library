window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Nobel Prize winner's most influential and enduring personal writings, newly curated and introduced by acclaimed Camus scholar Alice Kaplan. </b></p> <p>Albert Camus (1913-1960) is unsurpassed among writers for a body of work that animates the wonder and absurdity of existence. <i>Personal Writings</i> brings together, for the first time, thematically-linked essays from across Camus's writing career that reflect the scope and depth of his interior life. Grappling with an indifferent mother and an impoverished childhood in Algeria, an ever-present sense of exile, and an ongoing search for equilibrium, Camus's personal essays shed new light on the emotional and experiential foundations of his philosophical thought and humanize his most celebrated works.</p>";
