window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Delve into a world both Real and Supernatural when North Carolina history mixes with the paranormal in this pulse-pounding series. With over 50,000 readers, the Max Porter Paranormal Mysteries is a highly addictive series that'll keep you listening late into the night. Fun, funny, suspenseful, and scary, this omnibus edition includes the first three books in the best-selling series. </p> <p><i>Southern Bound</i> (Book 1) </p> <p>When Max and Sandra Porter moved down to North Carolina, they thought they were getting a new beginning - good job, good pay, and a lovely little place in Winston-Salem. But the family that hired him to research land deals in North Carolina is not all that they seem. </p> <p>And when Max discovers that his office is haunted by Marshall Drummond, PI - a ghost from the 1940s - what started as a simple research job sinks him neck-deep in a world of old mysteries and dangerous enemies. One in which ghosts, witches, curses, and spells exist. One in which something as innocent as a book can turn deadly. </p> <p><i>Southern Charm</i> (Book 2) </p> <p>When Max and the gang are hired by an art forging ghost to find a lost painting, Max thinks it'll be easy money. But villains old and new come out, and the race is on for the painting and the secrets it contains. A race that will lead Max into a mess of magic spells, haunted houses, ancient curses, and even Blackbeard the Pirate. </p> <p><i>Southern Belle</i> (Book 3) </p> <p>Max thought he had enough trouble dealing with one witch in Winston-Salem. But a new case brings to light an entire coven of witches. </p> <p>Angry, cursed, dead witches. </p> <p>Things only get worse when the mysterious Hull family and the FBI start poking into Max's life. He'll need all his team can give with a case that involves the theft of a cursed bell, dark magic, spirit possession, and ghastly murders. </p> <p>All in all, just another day at the office for Max Porter. </p>";
