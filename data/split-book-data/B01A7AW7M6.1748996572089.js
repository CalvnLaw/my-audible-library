window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Theater Five</i> was ABC's attempt to revive radio drama during the early 1960s. The series name was derived from its time slot, 5:00 p.m. Running Monday through Friday, it was an anthology of short stories, each about 20 minutes long. News programs and commercials filled out the full 30 minutes. There was a good bit of science fiction, and some of the plots seem to have been taken from the daily newspaper. Fred Foy of <i>The Lone Ranger</i> fame was an ABC staff announcer in the early '60s who, among other duties, did <i>Theater Five</i>. </p> <p>From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group. </p>";
