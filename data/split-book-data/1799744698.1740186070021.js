window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In early nineteenth-century Russia, the threat of Napoleon’s invasion looms, and the lives of millions are about to be changed forever. This includes Pierre Bezúkhov, illegitimate son of an aristocrat; Andrew Bolkónski, ambitious military scion; and Natásha Rostóva, compassionate daughter of a nobleman. All of them are unprepared for what lies ahead. Alongside their fellow compatriots - a catalog of enduring literary characters - Pierre, Andrew, and Natásha will be irrevocably torn between fate and free will.</p> <p>Through the bonds of love and family, and all that can break them, Tolstoy examines the effects of war on every strata of society in his masterwork of intimate - and epic - social history.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>War and Peace</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
