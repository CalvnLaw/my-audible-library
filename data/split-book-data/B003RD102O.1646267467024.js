window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>BioWare and LucasArts - creators of the hugely popular Star Wars®: Knights of the Old Republic® video game - have combined their storytelling talents and cutting-edge technology for an innovative new massively multiplayer online role-playing game that allows players to create their own personal Star Wars adventure 3,500 years before the rise of Darth Vader. Now number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sean Williams brings the world of the game to life in his latest novel, <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance</i>.</p> <p>Tassaa Bareesh, a matriarch in the Hutt crime cartel, is holding an auction that’s drawing attention from across the galaxy. Representatives of both the Republic and the Sith Empire are present, along with a Jedi Padawan sent to investigate, a disenfranchised trooper drummed out of the Republic’s elite&nbsp; Blackstar Squad, and a mysterious Mandalorian with a private agenda. But the Republic’s envoy is not what he seems, the Empire’s delegate is a ruthless Sith apprentice, the Jedi Padawan is determined to do the right thing and terrified that he can’t, the trooper hopes to redeem her reputation, and the Mandalorian is somehow managing to keep one step ahead of everyone.</p> <p>None of these guests - invited or uninvited - have any intention of participating in the auction. Instead they plan to steal the prize, which is locked inside an impregnable vault: Two burned chunks of an exploded star cruiser, one of which may hold the key to the wealth of an entire world.</p> <p>But the truth about the treasure is dangerous and deadly. And in the end, Sith and Jedi, Republic and Empire, must do something they’ve never done before, something that all the agents of good and evil could never make them do: Join together to stop a powerful threat that could destroy the galaxy.</p>";
