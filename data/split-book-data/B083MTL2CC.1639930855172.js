window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1960, Ishmael Reed, then an aspiring young writer, interviewed Malcolm X for a local radio station in Buffalo, and the encounter cost Reed his job and changed his life. In <i>Malcolm and Me</i>, Reed, the author of such classic novels as <i>Mumbo Jumbo</i> and the winner of a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship, reveals a side of Malcolm X the public has never seen before, and explores how the civil rights firebrand influenced his own views on working and living and speaking out, and left a mark on generations of artists and activists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Malcolm X was one of the most influential human rights activists in history and his views on race, religion, and fighting back changed America and the world. Reed gives a clear-eyed view of what the man was really like - beyond the headlines and the myth-making. <i>Malcolm and Me </i>is also an intimately observed look at the development of an artist, and how chance encounters we have in our youth can transform who we are and the world we live in.</p>";
