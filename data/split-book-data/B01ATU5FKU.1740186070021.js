window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are few characters in literature more iconic than J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. Originally introduced in 1902 in another Barrie novel (<i>The Little White Bird</i>), Peter's story was expanded as a standalone novel in 1911 and since then has been memorably adapted for the movies, for television, and for stage. </p><p>Now, actress Lily Collins (<i>The Blind Side</i>, <i>The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</i>) brings new, youthful energy to Peter's magical adventures - her performance capturing the innocence and wonder of Barrie's original tale. Through Collins' voice you'll rediscover your favorite characters: Captain Hook, the Darlings, Tinker Bell, The Lost Boys, and a tick-tocking crocodile. And you'll fly along with Peter through Neverland - a place full of magic and adventure; a place where no one gets old. </p>";
