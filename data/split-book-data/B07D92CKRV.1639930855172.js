window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>December 1944: Deep in the Ardennes forest, a platoon of 18 men under the command of 20-year-old lieutenant Lyle Bouck huddle in their foxholes. Under attack and vastly outnumbered, they repulse three German assaults in a fierce day-long battle, killing more than 500 Germans.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only when Bouck's men run out of ammunition do they surrender. As POWs, Bouck's platoon experience an ordeal far worse than combat: trigger-happy German guards, Allied bombing raids, and a daily ration of thin soup. Somehow, the men of Bouck's platoon all miraculously survive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alex Kershaw brings to life the story of America's most decorated small unit of the war, and one of the most inspiring stories in American history.</p>";
