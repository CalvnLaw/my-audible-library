window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling coauthors Shäron Moalem and Daniel Kraus's terrifying sci-fi horror thriller takes place in a future that is much nearer than you think. It is a world where scientific experimentation is exploited for commercial profit and under-supervised cutting-edge technology creates a menace that threatens the very fabric of our existence.</b></p> <p><i>Wrath</i> is the story of Sammy, a lab rat instilled with human genes whose supersized intelligence helps him to engineer his escape into the world outside the lab: a world vastly ill-equipped to deal with the menace he represents. Modified through advances that have boosted his awareness of humankind’s cruelty in the name of science, Sammy has the potential to sire a rodent army capable of viciously overwhelming the human race. The key to Sammy’s capture and humanity’s salvation may be ten-year-old Dallas Underhill, whom Sammy adopts. But while Dallas and Sammy bond, time is running out for humankind: once Sammy sires his progeny, the exponential proliferation of his kind could spell the end of the world.</p> <p><b>For fans of dystopian works such as Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach Trilogy and Emily St. John Mandel’s </b><b><i>Station Eleven</i></b><b>, and fans of Neal Stephenson, Michael Crichton, and Blake Crouch. This heart-pounding, science-based thriller takes place in a possibly all-too-soon reality where the hazards and consequences.</b></p>";
