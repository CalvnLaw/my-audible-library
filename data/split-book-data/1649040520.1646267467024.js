window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With </b><b><i>Bringing Nature Home</i></b><b>, Doug Tallamy changed the conversation about gardening in America. His second book, the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller </b><b><i>Natureâ€™s Best Hope</i></b><b>, urged homeowners to take conservation into their own hands. Now, he is turning his advocacy to one of the most important species of the plant kingdom - the mighty oak tree.</b></p> <p>Oaks sustain a complex and fascinating web of wildlife. <i>The Nature of Oaks</i> reveals what is going on in oak trees month by month, highlighting the seasonal cycles of life, death, and renewal. From woodpeckers who collect and store hundreds of acorns for sustenance to the beauty of jewel caterpillars, Tallamy illuminates and celebrates the wonders that occur right in our own backyards. He also shares practical advice about how to plant and care for an oak, along with information about the best oak species for your area.</p> <p><i>The Nature of Oaks</i> will inspire you to treasure these trees and to act to nurture and protect them.&nbsp;</p>";
