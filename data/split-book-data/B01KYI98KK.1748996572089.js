window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The incredible true story of Clifton B. \"Lucky\" Cates, whose service in World War I and beyond made him a legend in the annals of the Marine Corps. </p> <p>Cates knew that he and his small band of marines were in a desperate spot. Before handing the note over to a runner, he added three words that would resound through Marine Corps history: <i>I WILL HOLD</i>. </p> <p>From the moment he first joined the Marine Reserves of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, Clifton B. Cates was determined to make his mark as a leader. Little did he know what he would truly accomplish in his legendary career. </p> <p>Not as well known as his contemporaries, such as Alvin C. York, his fame would not come from a single act of heroism but from his consistent and courageous demeanor throughout the war and beyond. In the bloody second half of 1918, with the 6th Marine Regiment, he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart, and the Silver Star; he was recognized by the French government with the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre; and he earned the nickname \"Lucky\". </p> <p><i>I Will Hold</i> is the inspiring, brutally vivid, and incredible true life story of a Marine Corps legend whose grit and unstoppable spirit on the battlefield matched his personal drive and sage wisdom off of it. </p>";
