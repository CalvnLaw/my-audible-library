window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the casket reached the front of the sanctuary, there was a loud cracking sound as the bottom fell out. And with a thump, down came Father Iggy.</p> <p>From shoot-outs at funerals to dead men screaming and runaway corpses, undertakers have plenty of unusual stories to tell - and a special way of telling them.</p> <p>In this macabre and moving compilation, funeral directors across the country share their most embarrassing, jaw-dropping, irreverent, and deeply poignant stories about life at death's door. Discover what scares them and what moves them to tears. Learn about rookie mistakes and why death sometimes calls for duct tape.</p> <p>Enjoy tales of the dearly departed spending eternity naked from the waist down and getting bottled and corked - in a wine bottle. And then meet their families - the weepers, the punchers, the stolidly dignified, and the ones who deliver their dead mother in a pickup truck.</p> <p>If there's one thing undertakers know, it's that death drives people crazy. These are the best \"bodies of work\" from America's darkest profession.</p>";
