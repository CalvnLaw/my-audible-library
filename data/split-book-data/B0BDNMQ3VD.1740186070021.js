The Strange Company is back and on the defensive.</b></p> <p>A massive invasion of a major Monarch world gets underway and the weird warrant officers of Voodoo Platoon move into their roles as combat multipliers at the front lines of an incredible no-holds-barred brawl for battlefield domination. Facing legions of Ultramarines, a weaponized population, and re-engineered combat veterans augmented by cybernetics, the stone-cold killers and ready-to-rumble rogues of Strange, fighting alongside a newly christened mech combat team, must hold a gateway landing zone against overwhelming odds.</p> <p>But the Ultras aren’t the premier elite fighting unit of the crumbling Monarch Empire for nothing. <i>Defeat</i> isn't even on the table for this military death cult of galactic warriors the Strange faces across a charred and dangerous battlefield.</p> <p>To the legendary Ultramarines, this is the last battle; the final conflict, and nothing less than their honor and a place in history are at stake. To survive, Reaper, Dog, and Voodoo Platoons will have to play every dirty trick in the book of war in a desperate, high-cycle, ride-the-lightning defense of a bad LZ where both sides know what they do here will echo into eternity.</p> <p>The tragedy of the Strange Company continues on LZ Heartbreak. Just because it’s a bad idea, doesn’t mean it won’t be fun.</p>";
