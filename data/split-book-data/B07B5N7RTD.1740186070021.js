window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p> The powerful story of the Red Army's battle of liberation against the Nazi invader - from Stalingrad all the way to Berlin. </p> <p>In February 1943, German forces surrendered to the Red Army at Stalingrad, and the tide of war turned. By May 1945 Soviet soldiers had stormed Berlin and brought down Hitler's regime. </p> <p><i>Total War </i>follows the fortunes of these fighters as they liberated Russia and the Ukraine from the Nazi invader and fought their way into the heart of the Reich. It reveals the horrors they experienced - the Holocaust, genocide and the mass murder of Soviet POWs - and shows the Red Army, brutalised by war, taking its terrible revenge on the German civilian population. </p> <p>For the first time, Russian veterans are candid about the terrible atrocities their own army committed. But they also describe their struggle to raise themselves from the abyss of hatred. Their war against the Nazis - which in large part brought the Second World War in Europe to an end - is a tarnished but deeply moving story of sacrifice and redemption. </p>";
