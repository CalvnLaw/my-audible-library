window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>December 1944. For the besieged American defenders of Bastogne, time was running out…</i> </p> <p>Hitler's forces had pressed in on the small Belgian town in a desperate offensive designed to push back the Allies, starting the Battle of the Bulge. So far, the US soldiers had managed to repel waves of attackers and even a panzer onslaught, but as their ammunition dwindled, the weary paratroopers of the 101st Airborne could only hope for a miracle - a miracle in the form of General George S. Patton and his Third Army. </p> <p>More than a hundred miles away, Patton, ordered to race his men to Bastogne, was already putting in motion the most crucial charge of his career. Tapped to spearhead his counterstrike against the Wehrmacht was the Fourth Armored Division, a bloodied but experienced unit that had fought and slogged its way across France. But blazing a trail into Belgium meant going up against some of the best infantry and tank units in the German Army. Failure to reach Bastogne in time could result in the overrunning of the 101st - a catastrophic defeat that could turn the tide of the war and secure victory for the Nazis. </p> <p>In <i>Patton at the Battle of the Bulge</i>, Army veteran and historian Leo Barron explores one of the most famous yet little understood clashes of the war, a vitally important chapter in one of history's biggest battles.</p>";
