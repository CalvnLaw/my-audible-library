window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wanda Sykes, LeVar Burton, Leslie Odom, Jr., and Gabourey Sidibe head a cast of beloved actors performing 23 selections from the speeches, sermons, and essays of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—many never recorded during his lifetime. For the first time, teachers, students, and thoughtful listeners can hear dramatic interpretations of Dr. King’s words, chosen and introduced by Cornel West.</p> <p>Many Americans didn’t experience Dr. Martin Luther King’s oratory, or the hope and fears of the Civil Rights era. His words and dreams remain relevant, necessary, and inspirational today. <i>The Radical King</i> was a labor of love for Audible, the family of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and an A-list team of activist voice talent.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
