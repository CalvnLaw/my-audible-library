But there is another question <i>Good Life, Good Death</i> asks us to contemplate: How does the idea of life after death affect how we live our lives?&nbsp;</p> <p>Gelek Rimpoche tells stories of the mystical Tibet he lived in, as well as the contemporary America he became a citizen of, and shares the wisdom of the great masters. He asks us to open our minds and see if we can entertain a bigger picture of life after life, even for a moment. He makes the connection between powerful emotions such as anger, obsession, jealousy, and pride, and our past as well as our future.</p>";
