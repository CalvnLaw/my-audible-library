One of the colonies, Rotor, has broken away from the solar system to create its own renegade utopia around an unknown red star two light-years from Earth: a star named Nemesis. </p> <p>Now a 15-year-old Rotorian girl has learned of the dire threat that nemesis poses to Earth’s people - but she is prevented from warning them. Soon, she will realize that Nemesis endangers Rotor as well. And so it will be up to her alone to save both Earth and Rotor as - drawn inexorably by Nemesis, the death star - they hurtle toward certain disaster.</p>";
