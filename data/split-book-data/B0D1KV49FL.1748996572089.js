window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the #1 Kickstarter campaign of all time—#1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson adds to his Cosmere universe shared by Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive with a new standalone novel that combines fantasy and science fiction. Narrated by William DeMeritt.</p> <p>Running. Putting distance between himself and the relentless Night Brigade has been Nomad’s strategy for years. Staying one or two steps ahead of his pursuers by skipping through the Cosmere from one world to the next.</p> <p>But now, his powers too depleted to escape, Nomad finds himself trapped on Canticle, a planet that will kill anyone who doesn’t keep moving. Fleeing the fires of a sunrise that melts the very stones, he is instantly caught up in the struggle between a heartless tyrant and the brave rebels who defy him.</p> <p>Failure means a quick death, incinerated by the sun…or a lifetime as a mindless slave. Tormented by the consequences of his past, Nomad must fight not only for his survival—but also for his very soul.</p> <p>Note from Brandon:</p> <p>I sincerely believe that stories don’t live until they’re heard. While I would write even if no one were listening—it’s who I am—I thrive because I know the stories are being brought to life by all of you. In this, stories are a special kind of art. Each of you will visualize this book, and its characters, a little differently—you will each put your own stamp on it, making it yours. I don’t believe a story is quite finished until that has happened—until the dream in my head has become a reality (even if briefly) in yours.</p> <p>And so this book is yours, as they all are once you listen to them. Thank you so much for bringing life to my work, and to the Cosmere.</p>";
