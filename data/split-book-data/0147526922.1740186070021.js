Wilson Literary Science Writing Award</b></p> <p><b>\"Glorious...You will marvel at the brilliance and vast weirdness of your design.\" (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Bill Bryson, best-selling author of</b> <b><i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i></b><b>, takes us on a head-to-toe tour of the marvel that is the human body. As addictive as it is comprehensive, this is Bryson at his very best, a must-listen owner's manual for everybody.</b></p> <p>Bill Bryson once again proves himself to be an incomparable companion as he guides us through the human body - how it functions, its remarkable ability to heal itself, and (unfortunately) the ways it can fail. Full of extraordinary facts (your body made a million red blood cells since you started reading this) and irresistible Bryson-esque anecdotes, <i>The Body</i> will lead you to a deeper understanding of the miracle that is life in general and you in particular. </p> <p>As Bill Bryson writes, \"We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted.\" <i>The Body</i> will cure that indifference with generous doses of wondrous, compulsively listenable facts and information. </p>";
