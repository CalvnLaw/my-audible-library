window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Ghost Empire</i> is a rare treasure - an utterly captivating blend of the historical and the contemporary, realised by a master storyteller. </p> <p>In 2014, Richard Fidler and his son Joe made a journey to Istanbul. Fired by Richard's passion for the rich history of the dazzling Byzantine Empire - centred around the legendary Constantinople - we are swept into some of the most extraordinary tales in history. The clash of civilisations, the fall of empires, the rise of Christianity, revenge, lust, murder. </p> <p>Turbulent stories from the past are brought vividly to life at the same time as a father navigates the unfolding changes in his relationship with his son. <i>Ghost Empire</i> is a revelation: a beautifully told ode to a lost civilisation, and a warmly observed father-son adventure far from home. </p>";
