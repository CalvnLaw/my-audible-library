window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For the first time in a beautiful new edition, this omnibus will collect together the original official novelizations of both </b><b><i>Ghostbusters 1</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>2</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Relive the classic <i>Ghostbusters</i> stories with the original movie novelizations republished for the first time since 1980s. </p> <p>When Dr. Peter Venkman and his Columbia University colleagues are kicked out of their prestigious academic posts, they start a private practice as professional ghost-catchers. Although things do not start auspiciously for the three parascientists, their television advertisements finally pay off when beautiful Dana Barrett contracts them. It seems her apartment has become the entryway for ghastly ghosts and goofy ghouls hellbent on terrorizing New York City. Soon, they’re not just going to her rescue, but trying to rid the whole city of the slimy creatures. </p> <p>After waging a war on slime that cost New York City millions, the Ghostbusters find themselves out of business until an ancient tyrant, preparing a return to the Earthly domain through his portrait at the Manhattan Museum of Modern Art, sets his sights on Dana Barrett’s baby as the new home for his wicked soul!</p>";
