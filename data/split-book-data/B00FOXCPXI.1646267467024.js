window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The celebrated 2010 HBO miniseries <i>The Pacific</i>, winner of eight Emmy Awards, was based on two classic books about the War in the Pacific, <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i> and <i>With The Old Breed</i>. Audible Studios, in partnership with Playtone, the production company co-owned by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, and creator of the award-winning HBO series <i>Band of Brothers, John Adams</i>, and <i>The Pacific</i>, as well as the HBO movie <i>Game Change</i>, has created new recordings of these memoirs, narrated by the stars of the miniseries. James Badge Dale (who portrayed Robert Leckie) and Joseph Mazello (who played Eugene Sledge) bring all the passion and emotion of their riveting television performances to these new audio productions. </p> <p>In <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i>, Robert Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in January 1942, shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This riveting first-person account follows his odyssey from basic training on Parris Island, South Carolina, all the way to the raging battles in the Pacific, where some of the war's fiercest fighting took place. Recounting his service with the 1st Marine Division and the brutal action on Guadalcanal, New Britain, and Peleliu, Leckie spares no detail of the horrors and sacrifices of war, painting an unvarnished portrait of how real warriors are made, fight, and often die in the defense of their country. </p> <p>From the live-for-today rowdiness of marines on leave to the terrors of jungle warfare against an enemy determined to fight to the last man, Leckie describes what war is really like when victory can only be measured inch by bloody inch. Woven throughout are Leckie's hard-won, eloquent, and thoroughly unsentimental meditations on the meaning of war and why we fight. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO</b>: Tom Hanks, one of the executive producers, has written and narrated an original introduction to <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i>, where he describes his appreciation for the book's author, the narrators, and the soldiers who had fought in the cauldron of the Pacific Theater during World War II.</p>";
