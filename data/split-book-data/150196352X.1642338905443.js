window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A landmark new translation of a Calvino classic, a whimsical, spirited novel that imagines a life lived entirely on its own terms.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cosimo di Rondo, a young Italian nobleman of the 18th century, rebels against his parents by climbing into the trees and remaining there for the rest of his life. He adapts efficiently to an existence in the forest canopy - he hunts, sows crops, plays games with earthbound friends, fights forest fires, solves engineering problems, and even manages to have love affairs. From his perch in the trees, Cosimo sees the Age of Enlightenment pass by and a new century dawn.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Baron in the Trees</i> exemplifies Calvino's peerless ability to weave tales that sparkle with enchantment. This new English rendering by acclaimed translator Ann Goldstein breathes new life into one of Calvino's most beloved works.</p>";
