window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For 20 years <i>Suspense</i> brought radio listeners incalculable sharp inhales, tingled spines, and shortened breaths. Every week brought a fresh slate, a fresh cast, and a fresh challenge with an attention to detail and consistent script quality that never lost ground. From beginning to end, Suspense stands as one of radio’s lasting achievements - and the creative peak of the broadcast anthology format. </p> <p><i>Suspense: Omnibus</i> includes 20 of the best episodes from the series that, true to form, feature ordinary people - painfully ordinary - who through no fault of their own, find themselves immersed in extraordinary circumstances. Small, innocuous, it-doesn’t-really-hurt-anyone crimes spiral wildly out of control. Innocent white lies turned dark and terrifying in their consequences. Playing these ordinary people are extraordinary stars including John Dehner, Charles Laughton, Howard Duff, Rosalind Russell, Dick Powell, Ray Milland, Gregory Peck, Sheldon Leonard, Vincent Price, Dana Andrews, William Bendix, Lena Horne, Orson Welles, Ed Gardner, and more. For radio enthusiasts, there’s nothing quite like <i>Suspense</i>! Digitally remastered for your listening enjoyment. </p> <p>Episodes include: The Bodysnatchers 11-24-42; Life Ends at Midnight 02-17-44; The Palmer Method 04-20-44; The Dark Tower 05-04-44; You Were Wonderful 11-09-44; A Guy Gets Lonely 04-05-45; Pearls Are a Nuisance 04-19-45; Two Birds With One Stone 05-17-45; My Dear Niece 01-24-46; The Name of the Beast 04-11-46; Feast of the Furies 07-11-46; Tree of Life 01-02-47; The Twist 09-11-47; Nightmare 09-01-49; Chicken Feed 09-08-49; Blind Date 09-29-49; Slow Burn 02-23-50; When the Bough Breaks 05-03-51; Neil Cream, Doctor of Poison 09-17-51; The Man with the Steel Teeth 02-17-55.</p>";
