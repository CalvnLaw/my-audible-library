Covering issues such as duty, forgiveness, brotherhood, strength in adversity and the best way to approach life and death, the <i>Meditations</i> have inspired thinkers, poets and politicians since their first publication more than 500 years ago. Today, the book stands as one of the great guides and companions - a cornerstone of Western thought.&nbsp;</p> <p>Translation by George Long revised by Duncan Steen.&nbsp;</p>";
