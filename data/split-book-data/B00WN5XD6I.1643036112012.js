window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bill should know that you never complain in the Troopers. But when his new foot looks like it's turning into something green, scaly, and abundantly clawed, a visit to the medics would seem to be reasonable. But before he can say \"Quintiform computer error\", he seems to have got himself volunteered again, this time for a suicide mission on Tsuris - the planet nobody ever comes back from. </p><p>A number, exactly a billion in fact, of Tsurisians have no bodies at all to speak of and reside in bottles, which, as Bill remarks, is an awful lot of bottles. And Bill is going to need all the bottle he possesses to get himself out of this one.... </p><p>If you want to bravely probe where no one has ever probed before, then join Bill, Splock, and Captain Dirk as once again our Galactic Hero investigates new depths in the realms of the science-fiction clich√©. </p>";
