window.bookSummaryJSON = "This classic work by psychologist and social philosopher Eric Fromm builds upon his previous popular book <i>To Have or to Be?</i> <i>The Art of Being</i> teaches us to avoid the tantalizing illusions of our consumer-driven world by learning to function as a whole person from a state of inner completeness or being. The transition from an identity of <i>having</i> to <i>being</i> creates a state of enlightened psychological and spiritual happiness. <p> Fromm observes that the modern person is less a self-reflective being than a composite of data promoted by the mass media, and he encourages us to pursue true self-awareness beyond simple political, ideological, and religious cliches. By learning to be centered in the self, the individual is less swayed by the endless pressures and dissatisfactions of the culture of consumerism.</p>";
