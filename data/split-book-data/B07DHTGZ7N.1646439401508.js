window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You get ready to die the way you get ready for a trip. Start by realizing you don't know the way. Listen to a few travel guides. Study the language, look at maps, gather equipment. Let yourself imagine what it will be like. Pack your bags. This book is one of those travel guides - a guide to preparing for your own death and the deaths of people close to you.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fact of death is hard to believe. Sallie Tisdale explores our fears and all the ways death and talking about death make us uncomfortable - but she also explores its intimacies and joys. Tisdale looks at grief, what the last days and hours of life are like, and what happens to dead bodies.<i> Advice for Future Corpses </i>includes exercises designed to make you think differently about the inevitable. She includes practical advice, personal experience, a little Buddhist philosophy, and stories.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this isn't a book of inspiration or spiritual advice - <i>Advice for Future Corpses</i> is about how you can get ready. Start by admitting that we are all future corpses.</p>";
