window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Life on the inside\" takes on a whole new meaning. A riot has broken out at Twin Towers Jail. Simeon, five of his fellow inmates, and the prison guards assigned to them have found themselves trapped in the inescapable confines of T-block during the lockdown. Boundaries of trust are pushed to the limit, as the survivors must learn to work together if they have any hope of escaping the horde of infected and the deadly secret that lies within Twin Tower's walls. </p> <p><i>We're Alive: Lockdown</i> serves as both a standalone and continuation of the We're Alive: A Story of Survival series. It answers questions, asks new ones, and keeps the listener guessing right up until the bitter end. </p> <p>What is \"audio theater for the mind?\" Think of it as a type of show that you can play in your head, guided by the narrative but carried by your imagination. Unlike film or television, an audio drama has the power to strike a deeper emotional connection with the audience. </p>";
