window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Durst consistently defies expectations.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review) </p> <p><b>From award-winning author Sarah Beth Durst, a stand-alone epic fantasy set in a brand-new world of towering mountains and sparkling cities, in which a band of aging warriors have a second chance to defeat dark magic and avenge a haunting loss. </b></p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, five heroes risked their lives to defeat the bone maker Eklor - a corrupt magician who created an inhuman army using animal bones. But victory came at a tragic price. Only four of the heroes survived. Since then, Kreya, the group’s leader, has exiled herself to a remote tower and devoted herself to one purpose: resurrecting her dead husband. But such a task requires both a cache of human bones and a sacrifice - for each day he lives, she will live one less. </p> <p>She’d rather live one year with her husband than a hundred without him, but using human bones for magic is illegal in Vos. The dead are burned - as are any bone workers who violate the law. Yet Kreya knows where she can find the bones she needs: the battlefield where her husband and countless others lost their lives. </p> <p>But defying the laws of the land exposes a terrible possibility. Maybe the dead don’t rest in peace after all. </p> <p>Five warriors - one broken, one gone soft, one pursuing a simple life, one stuck in the past, and one who should dead. Their story should have been finished. But evil doesn’t stop just because someone once said, “the end”. </p>";
