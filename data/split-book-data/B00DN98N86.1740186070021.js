window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 25 years between the onset of the French Revolution in 1789 and the Bourbon Restoration after Napoleon in 1814 is an astonishing period in world history. This era shook the foundations of the old world and marked a permanent shift for politics, religion, and society - not just for France, but for all of Europe. An account of the events alone reads like something out of a thrilling novel:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Franceâ€™s oppressed and hungry masses rise up against their government.</li> <li>In Paris, crowds storm the Bastille looking for bread and weaponry.</li> <li>Rumors, panic, and fear grip the nation as it faces an uncertain future.</li> <li>The National Assembly adopts the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the first bold step toward the invention of democratic politics and a republican state.</li> <li>A young Corsican named Napoleon Bonaparte stuns Europe with his military strategy and political boldness.</li> </ul> <p><b>Living the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon</b> is your opportunity to learn the full story of this captivating period. Taught by Dr. Suzanne M. Desan, these 48 exciting lectures give you a broad and comprehensive survey of one of the most important eras in modern history.</p>";
