window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Suspense</i> went through several major phases, characterized by different hosts, sponsors, and director/producers. Formula plot devices were followed for all but a handful of episodes: The protagonist was usually a normal person suddenly dropped into a threatening or bizarre situation; solutions were \"withheld until the last possible second\"; and evildoers were usually punished in the end.</p> <p>This is the most comprehensive collection of the great series. This show really keeps the listener in suspense! Enjoy!</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> This is an historical recording. The audio quality represents the technology of the time when it was produced.</p>";
