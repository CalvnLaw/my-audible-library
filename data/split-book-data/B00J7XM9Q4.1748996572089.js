window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Art as Experience</i> evolved from John Dewey's Willam James Lectures, delivered at Harvard University from February to May 1931. </p> <p>In his Introduction, Abraham Kaplan places Dewey's philosophy of art within the context of his pragmatism. Kaplan demonstrates in Dewey's esthetic theory his traditional \"movement from a dualism to a monism\" and discusses whether Dewey's viewpoint is that of the artist, the respondent, or the critic. </p> <p>The book is published by Southern Illinois University Press. </p>";
