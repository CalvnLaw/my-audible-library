window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A thrilling adventure in a world one step away from total subjugation by machines </b></p> <p>After long years of war, the United States has sued for peace, yielding to a brutal coalition of nations ruled by fascist machines. One-quarter of the country is under foreign occupation. Manhattan has been annexed by a weird robot monarchy, and in Tennessee a permanent peace is being delicately negotiated between the battered remnants of the US government and an envoy of implacable machines.&nbsp;</p> <p>Canadian businessman Barry Simcoe arrives in occupied Chicago days before his hotel is attacked by a rogue war machine. In the aftermath, he meets a dedicated Russian medic with the occupying army and 19 Black Winter, a badly damaged robot. Together they stumble on a machine conspiracy to unleash a horrific plague - and learn that the fabled American resistance is not as extinct as everyone believes. Simcoe races against time to prevent the extermination of all life on the continent...and uncover a secret that America's machine conquerors are desperate to keep hidden.</p>";
