window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The untold story behind Mega-City One's most famous telepath and Judge Dredd partner, Judge Anderson, in her first year on the job! </p> <p>Mega-City One, 2100. Cassandra Anderson is destined to become Psi-Division's most famous Judge, foiling supernatural threats and policing Mega-City One's hearts and souls. For now, she's fresh out of Academy and Psi-Div themselves are still finding their feet. </p> <p>\"Heartbreaker\": After a string of apparently random, deadly assaults by customers at a dating agency, Anderson is convinced a telepathic killer is to blame. Putting her career on the line, the newly-trained Psi-Judge goes undercover to bring the romance-hating murderer to justice, with the big Valentine's Day parade coming up.... </p> <p>\"The Abyss\": Sent to interrogate Moriah Blake, leader of the notorious terror group Bedlam, Anderson gets just one snippet of information - Bedlam's planning on detonating a huge bomb - before Blake's followers take over the Block. It's a race against time, and Anderson's on her own amongst the inmates.... </p> <p>\"A Dream of the Nevertime\": Anderson - a rookie no more, with a year on the streets under her belt - contracts what appears to be a deadly psychic virus, and must explore the weirdest reaches of the Cursed Earth in search of a cure. She must face mutants, mystics, and all the strangeness the land can throw at her as she wrestles weird forces.... </p> <p>Author bio: Alec Worley was a projectionist and a film critic before writing short <i>Future Shock</i> strips for 2000 AD and creating two original series: werewolf apocalypse saga <i>Age of the Wolf</i> (with Jon Davis-Hunt) and \"spookpunk\" adventure comedy <i>Dandridge</i> (with Warren Pleece). He writes the <i>Teenage Muttant Ninja Turtles</i> comics for Panini in the UK and has also written <i>Judge Dredd, Robo-Hunter, Tharg's 3rillers</i> and <i>Tales from the Black Museum</i> and <i>Realm of the Damned</i>.
