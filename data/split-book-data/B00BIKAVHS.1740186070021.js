window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Winner, Multi-Voiced Performance, 2014</b></p> <p><i>World War Z: The Complete Edition (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War</i> is a new version of Max Brooks' episodic zombie novel. The abridged versions of the original stories are now joined with new, unabridged recordings of the episodes that were not included in the original (abridged) version of the audiobook. These additional episodes feature a star-studded cast of narrators to coincide with the upcoming release of the film. </p> <p>New narrators include Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese, <i>Spiderman</i> star Alfred Molina, <i>The Walking Dead</i> creator Frank Darabont, rapper Common, Firefly star Nathan Fillion, <i>Shaun of the Dead'</i>s Simon Pegg, and members of the casts of <i>Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Heroes</i> and more! Max Brooks will be reprising his role as The Interviewer. </p> <p>The original abridged edition, released in 2006, won an Audie Award for Best Multi-Voiced Performance. Original cast members include Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, Carl &amp; Rob Reiner, and John Turturro. </p> <p>In this new classic of apocalyptic fiction that feels all too real, the Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. The documentary-style oral history records the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. </p> <p>Featuring five more hours of previously unrecorded content, this full-cast recording is read by F. Murray Abraham, Alan Alda, René Auberjonois, Becky Ann Baker, Dennis Boutsikaris, Bruce Boxleitner, Max Brooks, Nicki Clyne, Common, Denise Crosby, Frank Darabont, Dean Edwards, Mark Hamill, Nathan Fillion, Maz Jobrani, Frank Kamai, Michelle Kholos, John McElroy, Ade M’Cormack, Alfred Molina, Parminder Nagra, Ajay Naidu, Masi Oka, Steve Park, Kal Penn, Simon Pegg, Jürgen Prochnow, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Henry Rollins, Jeri Ryan, Jay O. Sanders, Martin Scorsese, Paul Sorvino, David Ogden Stiers, Brian Tee, John Turturro, Eamonn Walker, Ric Young, and Waleed Zuaiter.</p>";
