window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An up-to-the-minute survival guide from the creator of </b><b><i>Survivorman </i></b><b>explores how to stay alive in the wild, in the jungle, in the desert, and in urban disasters. </b></p> <p>From the sun-scorched sands of the Kalahari to the snake-infested jungles of the Amazon, Les Stroud has made a life of surviving in the harshest - and most remote - regions on Earth. </p> <p>Now, the creator, producer, and host of the hit television program <i>Survivorman </i>transfers his decades of knowledge and experience to the audiobook <i>Survive!</i>, a practical guide that gives everyday listeners a no-nonsense look at the real world of survival. </p> <p>Stroud offers listeners the essential skills and tactics necessary to endure in any corner of the globe, along with a wealth of insider information born of his own experiences in the outdoors and unavailable in any other book. Listeners will learn: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>How to make a survival shelter and why a lean-to is largely a waste of time. </li> <li>Why survival kits are important and why you should make your own. </li> <li>Where to find water and why drinking contaminated water is sometimes warranted. </li> <li>How to locate and trap small animals and why the notion of tracking and hunting large game is largely a pipe dream. </li> </ul> <p>Whether seasoned in the outdoor arts or new to adventuring, all listeners will learn something from <i>Survive! </i>Stroud's many colorful anecdotes and cut-to-the-chase philosophy not only make for an entertaining listen, but also enhance anyone's ability to focus on the main goal when everything else has gone wrong - survival. </p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
