window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by Peter Godfrey-Smith with Mitch Riley.</b></p> <p><b>The scuba-diving philosopher who wrote </b><b><i>Other Minds</i></b><b> explores the origins of animal consciousness.</b></p> <p>Dip below the ocean’s surface and you are soon confronted by forms of life that could not seem more foreign to our own: sea sponges, soft corals, and serpulid worms, whose rooted bodies, intricate geometry, and flower-like appendages are more reminiscent of plant life or even architecture than anything recognizably animal. Yet these creatures are our cousins. As fellow members of the animal kingdom — the Metazoa— they can teach us much about the evolutionary origins of not only our bodies, but also our minds.</p> <p>In his acclaimed 2016 book, <i>Other Minds</i>, the philosopher and scuba diver Peter Godfrey-Smith explored the mind of the octopus — the closest thing to an intelligent alien on Earth. In <i>Metazoa</i>, Godfrey-Smith expands his inquiry to animals at large, investigating the evolution of subjective experience with the assistance of far-flung species. As he delves into what it feels like to perceive and interact with the world as other life-forms do, Godfrey-Smith shows that the appearance of the animal body well over half a billion years ago was a profound innovation that set life upon a new path. In accessible, riveting prose, he charts the ways that subsequent evolutionary developments — eyes that track, for example, and bodies that move through and manipulate the environment — shaped the subjective lives of animals. Following the evolutionary paths of a glass sponge, soft coral, banded shrimp, octopus, and fish, then moving onto land and the world of insects, birds, and primates like ourselves, <i>Metazoa</i> gathers their stories together in a way that bridges the gap between mind and matter, addressing one of the most vexing philosophical problems: that of consciousness.</p> <p>Combining vivid animal encounters with philosophical reflections and the latest news from biology, <i>Metazoa</i> reveals that even in our high-tech, AI-driven times, there is no understanding our minds without understanding nerves, muscles, and active bodies. The story that results is as rich and vibrant as life itself.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux&nbsp;</b></p>";
