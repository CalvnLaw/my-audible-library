window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jackie Cantwell, sound meditation practitioner, guides you to deliberately think about what's weighing on your mind for tomorrow, then release that tension through a series of inhales and exhales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jackie Cantwell is the director of Medi Club and musician for The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprah’s 2020 Vision Tour with WW). It was founded by Jesse Israel, whose own experience with debilitating panic attacks forced him to step back from a successful career as a music executive to seek help. When he came upon meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Guided by leading experts and personalities in wellness, sleep meditations are brief listens focused specifically on helping you decompress before bed. They don’t require any previous experience - they're easy to get into and designed to help you take a moment at day’s end to just relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This title is part of The Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to invite relaxation and sleep. New and free for members.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jackie Cantwell: Crystal bowls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
