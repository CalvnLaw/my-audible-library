window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ever wonder what it would be like to have chosen a different life path? In these moments, looking back may be the best way forward.</p> <p><i>Some People Have Real Problems</i>, written by Brit Bennett, the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Vanishing Half</i>, and performed by Tessa Thompson, is a darkly funny short story about one woman’s reflections on the routes she’s taken through life and the detours she’s made along the way.</p> <p>Doubts and guilt swirl through her mind as she rides the train to her fertility appointment. Each stop stirs up introspective thoughts on her marriage, the loss of her baby, and the lover who got away—contemplations that push her ever closer to wondering if she’s made the right decisions.</p> <p>This masterful tale is an intrinsically relatable, courageous journey of self-reflection. It reminds us that while life may not always go as planned, we all possess the strength to move ahead.</p>";
