window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Astra Militarum novel.</b></p> <p>The Death Korps of Krieg are deployed to a soul-crushing siege in the Octarius War Zone. They’re the right regiment for the job, though victory might come at a price that some might balk to pay.</p> <p><b>Listen to it because: </b>Steve Lyons lifts the mask on the enigmatic Death Korps of Krieg, to show us the true horror that lies at the heart of this storied regiment. If you’re looking for a meat-grinder war, you’ve found it.</p> <p><b>The story: </b>Krieg is a dead world.</p> <p>Fifteen hundred years ago, it declared its independence from the Imperium of Man and paid the price. One loyal soul defied its treacherous rulers and laid the world to waste. From these ashes emerged a unique fighting force, forged and tempered in nuclear fire....</p> <p>Today, the Death Korps of Krieg lay siege to a captured hive city on the outskirts of the system-spanning Octarius War, in a desperate attempt to secure the cordon that stops untold masses of Orks and Tyranids from spilling out into the Imperium at large. The Korpsmen are relentless, ruthless, implacable and unstoppable, even in the face of a war that seems unwinnable. How far will they go to achieve victory, and is history doomed to repeat itself?</p> <p>Written by Steve Lyons. Narrated by Timothy Watson. Runtime nine hours 34 minutes.</p>";
