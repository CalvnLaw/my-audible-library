When terrorist attacks leave millions dead, academy’s cadets are drafted to fight the latest corporate war.</p> <p>But what happens when the twins discover that the terrorist enemy they’re fighting isn’t the real enemy? Will a pair of orphans follow the orders of an immoral corporation, or will they find that fighting against tyranny is worth everything?</p> <p><b>Experience the start of an exciting new military sci-fi series by Amazon best-selling authors Jamie McFarlane and Rachel Aukes.
