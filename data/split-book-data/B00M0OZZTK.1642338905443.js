We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.\" (Emperor Palpatine)</b> </p> <p>For a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights brought peace and order to the Galactic Republic, aided by their connection to the mystical energy field known as the Force. But they were betrayed - and the entire galaxy has paid the price. It is the Age of the Empire. </p> <p>Now Emperor Palpatine, once Chancellor of the Republic and secretly a Sith follower of the dark side of the Force, has brought his own peace and order to the galaxy. Peace through brutal repression, and order through increasing control of his subjects’ lives. </p> <p>But even as the Emperor tightens his iron grip, others have begun to question his means and motives. And still others, whose lives were destroyed by Palpatine’s machinations, lay scattered about the galaxy like unexploded bombs, waiting to go off.... </p> <p>The first Star Wars novel created in collaboration with the Lucasfilm Story Group, <i>Star Wars: A New Dawn</i> is set during the legendary \"Dark Times\" between Episodes III and IV and tells the story of how two of the lead characters from the animated series <i>Star Wars Rebels</i> first came to cross paths. Featuring a foreword by Dave Filoni.</p>";
