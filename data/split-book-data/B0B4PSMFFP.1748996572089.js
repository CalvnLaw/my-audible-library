His new rank means only that he has the authority to negotiate with the Syndics, who have suffered tremendous losses and may finally be willing to end the war. With grim determination, Geary leads the fleet back out into Syndic space.</p> <p>This seasoned commander knows surrender never comes easy. But even as he steels himself to confront the immediate enemy, he is all too aware that a greater alien threat lurks on the far side of Syndic-occupied space.</p>";
