window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Yevgeni Nikolaev was one of Russia's leading snipers in World War II, and his memoir provides an unparalleled account of front-line action in crucial theaters of war. Nikolaev is credited with a remarkable 324 kills, and his wartime service included time in the siege of Leningrad in 1941/1942. </p> <p>His memoir is not a neutral, apolitical account - far from it. Nikolaev asserts, for example, that Finland attacked Russia. As a member of the NKVD, it is not surprising that his memoir is full of historical misinterpretation and justification of the agency's actions.</p> <p>In vivid, arresting recollections he paints his actions in a saintly, heroic light. He describes the comfort of the German foxholes, wired with telephone connections, relative to the Russians who fasted without food or water, awaiting the moment for a perfect shot. He claims the Russian soldier was a moral warrior, killing only with head or heart shots.</p> <p>In addition to describing details of his kills, Nikolaev explains how his life was saved when an explosive rifle bullet struck a watch that he kept in his jacket pocket. His life was saved by a surgeon who extracted all the watch parts.</p>";
