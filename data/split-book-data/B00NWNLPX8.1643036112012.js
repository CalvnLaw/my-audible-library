window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A story of sacrifice and defiance at Guadalcanal, from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling coauthor of <i>A Higher Call</i> and <i>Biggest Brother</i>. </p> <p>On the killing ground that was the island of Guadalcanal, a 2,000-yard-long ridge rose from the jungle canopy. Behind it lay the all-important air base of Henderson Field. And if Henderson Field fell, it would mean the almost certain death or capture of all 12,500 marines on the island. </p> <p>But the marines positioned on the ridge were no normal fighters - they were the hard-fighting men of Edson's Raiders, an elite fighting unit within an already elite Marine Corps. Handpicked for their toughness and submitted to a rigorous training program to weed out those less fit, they were the best of the best. </p> <p>For two hellish nights in September 1942, about 840 marines - commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Merritt Austin \"Red Mike\" Edson - fought one of the most pivotal battles of World War II in the Pacific, clinging desperately to their position on what would soon be known as Bloody Ridge. </p> <p>Wave after wave of attacking Japanese soldiers were repelled by the Raiders, who knew that defeat and retreat were simply not options. In the end, and - against all odds, - the defenders prevailed. </p> <p><i>Bloody Ridge and Beyond</i> is the story of the First Marine Raider Battalion, which showed courage and valor in the face of overwhelming numbers, as told by Marlin Groft, a man who was a member of this incredible fighting force.</p>";
