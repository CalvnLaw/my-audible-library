window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the creator of the wildly popular webcomic <i>xkcd</i> comes this hilarious and informative book of answers to important questions you probably never thought to ask. </p> <p>Millions of people visit xkcd.com each week to read Randall Munroe's iconic webcomic. His stick-figure drawings about science, technology, language, and love have a large and passionate following. Fans of <i>xkcd</i> ask Munroe a lot of strange questions.

If there were a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last? </p> <p>In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, complemented by signature <i>xkcd</i> comics.
