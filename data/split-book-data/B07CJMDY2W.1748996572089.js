window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau reflected on simpler living in the natural world. By removing himself from the distractions of materialism, Thoreau hoped to not only improve his spiritual life but also gain a better understanding of society through solitary introspection.</p> <p>In <i>Walden</i>, Thoreau condenses his two-year, two-month, two-day stay into a single year, using the four seasons to symbolize human development - a cycle of life shared by both nature and man. A celebration of personal renewal through self-reliance, independence, and simplicity, composed for all of us living in “quiet desperation,” <i>Walden</i> is eternal.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>Walden</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>Walden (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
