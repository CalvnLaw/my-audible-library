window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner: Audible's Best of 2016 - Classic </b></p> <p>\"<i>Anna Karenina</i> is one of my favorite books. But when I agreed to read it for Audible, I had no idea how much work it would be, how intense it would be, and how deeply I would fall in love with it. There were places where I thought 'if I don't give Alexey Alexandrovitch the respect that he deserves in my reading of this scene, a critical part of the book will be ruined. If I don't give EVERYONE the utmost respect and understanding, I'm not doing justice to this brilliantly compassionate book.' But at the same time, I also wanted to have a light touch in the way I played the different characters, so that the magnificence of the novel could shine through. I feel like performing this novel is one of the major accomplishments of my work life - it was so challenging and so deep, a real pleasure.\" (Narrator Maggie Gyllenhaal) </p> <p>Leo Tolstoy's classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married Anna Karenina, and her tragic affair with dashing Count Vronsky. Maggie Gyllenhaal (<i>The Dark Knight</i>, <i>The Honourable Woman</i>) cites Tolstoy's epic as one of her favorite books of all time, and her love for the literature permeates her performance. <i>Anna Karenina</i> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life. </p>";
