Astronauts undergo some of the most rigorous training, intensive health screening, and psychological testing in the world – and that’s before they even leave this planet’s atmosphere. It’s a life experience and journey that could prove invaluable to us here on Earth also.</p> <p>In this eight-part podcast series, leading astronauts Nicole Stott and Helen Sharman pick their favourite stories from space – to help us build on our everyday skills and emotions to enhance our lives. Drawing on personal insights from fellow astronauts plus evidence from acclaimed wellbeing experts, they go beyond the benefits of all the training, tools and technologies that they've used in their careers and ask how the knowledge gained from space exploration can elevate and inspire us. Not only as individuals but also as communities, helping us make the world a better, more co-operative, kinder place.</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
