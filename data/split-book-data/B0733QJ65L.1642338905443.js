This PDF includes the audiobook chapter numbers, to make navigation easier. </p> <p>Excerpt from the introduction: </p> <p>\"When the first Conan of Cimmeria story appeared in the pages of <i>Weird Tales</i> magazine in December 1932, nothing quite like it had ever before appeared in print. Author Robert E. Howard had been writing stories broadly similar to it for half a decade; but it was with Conan, and the Hyborian Age storyworld in which he was placed, that Howard finally fully doped out the sub-genre that would become known as \"sword and sorcery\", of which Howard is today considered the founding father. </p> <p>\"Conan's origins date back to an experiment in 1926 titled \"The Shadow Kingdom\", featuring the character Kull, exile of Atlantis. The idea - Howard's great innovation - was, at its core, historical fiction set in a pre-historical period. That pre-historical period - being, of course, lost in the mists of time - could contain anything Howard might like to include: evil races of sentient snake-things, sorcerers, undead creatures, demons walking upon the earth, anything. </p> <p>\"In other words, Howard was creating a secular mythology.\" </p>";
