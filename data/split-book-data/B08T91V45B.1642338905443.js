window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you miss a good night's sleep? If you have trouble relaxing, turning your mind off, and lulling the body to sleep, you are not alone.</p> <p>This is a really common problem, and the collection of calming tales inside this audiobook is your answer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Do you remember going to bed as a child, hearing those wonderful stories your mom or dad told you? Do you remember how they made you feel? The imagery you would remember?&nbsp;Regardless of what type of tales you heard, bedtime stories are wonderful for falling asleep. Most of them have soft, pleasant words that people love to hear.</p> <p>The same atmosphere lives in <i>Bedtime Stories for Adults</i>, but here, it allows you to meditate in a state of deep relaxation using hypnosis to overcome insomnia and fall asleep fast. The goal of sleep hypnosis is to replace your stream of thoughts with a new stream of information - the story. Rather than keeping you on your feet and alert, these stories are proven to calm your mind and body down.&nbsp;</p> <p>You will dump your negative thoughts, and you will embrace the visualization of the relaxing elements of the tale. You will:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Dive into an infinite bath and listen to what the water has to say</li> <li>Sense the flow of the changing seasons</li> <li>Lay on the sands of a tropical island</li> <li>And much more</li> </ul> <p>No matter how stressed you feel, these stories are born to help adults unwind at the end of a long day. Just listen to one of them before going to sleep. You’ll be able to keep stressors off your bed and fall asleep soundly.</p> <p><b>Ready to dive deep into your dreams? Don’t wait any longer. Start tonight. Get this audiobook now.</b></p>";
