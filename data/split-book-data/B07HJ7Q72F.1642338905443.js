window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Honey bees get all the press, but the fascinating story of North America's native bees - an endangered species essential to our ecosystems and food supplies - is just as crucial. <i>Our Native Bees</i> is the result of Paige Embry's yearlong quest to learn more about these forgotten, yet fundamental, creatures.</p> <p>Through interviews with farmers, gardeners, scientists, and bee experts, Embry explores the importance of native bees and focuses on why they play a key role in gardening and agriculture. The people and stories are compelling: Embry goes on a bee hunt with the world expert on the likely extinct Franklin's bumble bee, raises blue orchard bees in her refrigerator, and learns about an organization that turns the out-of-play areas in golf courses into pollinator habitats.</p> <p>For bee enthusiasts and anyone who us curious about the natural world, <i>Our Native Bees</i> is an illuminating exploration of the pollinators essential to our survival.</p>";
