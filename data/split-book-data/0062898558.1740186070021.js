window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the youngest living recipient of the Medal of Honor, an extraordinary inspirational memoir that will change the life of every listener. </p> <p>“Kyle displayed a heroism in the blink of an eye that will inspire for generations.\" (President Barack Obama, at Kyle Carpenter's Medal of Honor ceremony)</p> <p>\"I want my story to help others see what’s extraordinary in themselves.\" (Kyle Carpenter)</p> <p>On November 21, 2010, US Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter was posted on a rooftop in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, when an enemy grenade skittered across the roof. Kyle’s post that afternoon, with his friend and fellow Marine Nick Eufrazio, had been eerily quiet; now, with no time to escape, they had to make a split-second decision or they would both be dead. Without a second thought, Kyle jumped on the grenade, a brutal killing device. His vision went blank, his entire body numb, he tried to move but could not. His gear had melted. It felt as though someone was pouring warm water all over him; he dazedly realized that the liquid was his own blood. He had made an instantaneous decision, almost on instinct, one that would change his life forever.</p> <p>Kyle’s heroic act saved Nick Eufrazio's life, but nearly cost Kyle his own. His heart flatlined three times. Wounded from head to toe, Kyle lost his right eye, as well as most of his face from the nose down. It would take dozens of surgeries and almost three years in and out of the hospital to reconstruct his body - and from there, he began the process of rebuilding his life. What he has accomplished in the last five years is truly extraordinary: He’s undergone extensive physical rehabilitation, graduated from college, ran three marathons, and embarked on a new career as a motivational speaker. And in 2014, he was awarded our nation’s highest military decoration, Medal of Honor, by President Barack Obama, making Carpenter the youngest living recipient of the award.</p> <p>“With that singular act of courage, Kyle, you not only saved your brother in arms, you displayed a heroism in the blink of an eye that will inspire for generations”, stated the president.</p> <p><i>You Are Worth It</i> is a memoir about the War in Afghanistan and Kyle’s heroics, yes, but it also is a manual for living. Organized around the credos that have guided Kyle’s life (from “Don’t Hide Your Scars” to “Call Your Mom”), the book encourages us to become our best selves in the time we've been given on earth. Above all, it’s about finding purpose in life, despite the significant challenges that may come your way. As Kyle writes, addressing us all: “You are worth it. You are. You are worth protecting, you are worth fighting for, you are worth time in a hospital bed and deep scars on my body....\"</p> <p>Moving and unforgettable, <i>You Are Worth It</i> is an astonishing memoir from one of our most extraordinary young leaders. </p>";
