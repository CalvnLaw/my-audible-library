window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you want to learn about the Soviet Union and Eastern Front during World War 2, then pay attention...</b></p> <p>No nation suffered more losses during the Second World War than the Soviet Union. The figure most historians recognize as roughly accurate is 20 million. The exact figure is impossible to tally for a number of reasons: destroyed records, inexact pre-war records, Soviet politicization of the population figures before and after the war, and much more.</p> <p>No matter what the exact total was, what is known is that the Soviet population only recovered its losses from the war in the late 1950s. For those of you unfamiliar with WWII, the combined losses sustained by the United States and Great Britain were just over 800,000 dead. The Soviets lost that many people during the Siege of Leningrad alone.</p> <p>In <i>Soviet Union in World War 2: A Captivating Guide to Life in the Soviet Union and Some of the Main Events on the Eastern Front Such as the Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Kursk, and Siege of Leningrad</i>, you will discover topics such as:</p> <ul> <li>Before the War</li> <li>Stalinism</li> <li>1938 and 1939</li> <li>Interlude</li> <li>Barbarossa</li> <li>War of Extermination</li> <li>The Major Battles</li> <li>And much, much more!</li> </ul> <p><b>So, if you want to learn more about the Soviet Union and Eastern Front during World War 2, scroll up and click the \"buy now\" button!</b></p>";
